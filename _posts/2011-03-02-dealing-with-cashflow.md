FIRST FRC teams face a dilema with their cashflow that can cause their pre-season to not be what they hoped.

When FRC teams apply for sponsors, it can take a while for them to get a response, and thus actually receive the money. For our team, we found that we actually received our money near late November. This caused us to loose valuable time in the Fall where we could have been designing, building, and testing different mechanisms. The knowledge gained by these exercises could have made a big difference when it came time to create our robot.

The best advice I can give teams is to invest money in spare materials and tools. Being able to prototype parts without making a run to the store is really a blessing. It promotes creativity and trying new things, which might give you the edge in a competition. Even if it doesn&#8217;t, having spare materials and tools on hand is good for other reasons.
