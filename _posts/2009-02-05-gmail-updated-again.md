Google is constantly adding new features to their Google Mail through the labs project they implemented a while back. The latest edition is labs. A little while back they created task , and everyone said &#8216;Hip Hip Hooray!&#8217;. I really didn&#8217;t find it completely useful, because I get Gmail through my iPod Touch via the built in app, and hardly ever look directly in Gmail unless I am replying to something. Now Tasks is Mobile. And now instead of linking emails to tasks that you have to do while your sitting at your computer, you can also link them to things you want to be reminded about in the real world, when you check your iPhone. I like it

And incase you weren&#8217;t on your toes, they did it again! Yes, Google Updated it, again!<!--more-->

About 5 hours before I wrote this post. They updated Gmail again. Now Gmail you can have multiple boxes open, next to your regular inbox, of individual labels. As Google posts [here](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/), each window is like a small &#8216;inbox&#8217; of your new labels. I haven&#8217;t gotten it in labs, but it sounds really cool. The benefits of having multiple inboxes open are that you can now filter out anything that doesn&#8217;t deserve you prime attention, in your inbox, and now instead have labels off to the side with all of this information. Here&#8217;s a picture. I can&#8217;t wait.
