The service that made automated direct messages for Twitter is finally putting a stop to what it has created. Jesse Stay created [SocialToo](http://socialtoo.com/), and with the advisory of Louis Gray, has grown the service to have over 13,000 members. Out of them, 6,000 are currently sending automated direct messages, but Jesse finds that some of these people aren’t genuine. He has removed the feature for sending automated messages to people who follow you, and offers a feature so they will try to stop as many messages coming from other services as possible. But that isn’t why I wrote this post. 

Twitter direct messages have been a pain in the ass for everyone, especially since people began sending them automatically. Loic LeMeur actually deleted all of his followers and started from scratch because of all the messages he had received. When you send automated, ungenuine messages to people automatically, no one likes them, no one feels special because of them, and some people unfollow you because of it. But that isn’t why I wrote this post. 

Friends, I wrote this post because every single social network you can think of has some form of private messaging that makes our lives miserable. I get Facebook Private Messages from people at my church, I get automated Twitter messages from people I follow, I get email from everyone who knows anything about anything, and every time I sign up for a new service, I get another inbox. 

People complain about having too many emails, but what if all those emails were scattered through every nook and cranny on the internet. What if all your business things got sent through LinkedIn, all your personal stuff through Facebook, everything else through Twitter, and then a mix of all the above in your regular email client. I’d go nuts! 

Not only do these inboxes give me 500 different places to check, they all don’t give me any basic functionality for doing proper messaging. I can’t forward things to anyone and I can only send attachments in certain formats. 

I think that these Social Networks need to get their butts into gear and make it so that I either want to use their messaging system, or it allows me to get all my messages in my email, and reply with email, using all the features I expect like attachments and images. Having too many emails is annoying, but having too many emails in too many places is even more annoying.
