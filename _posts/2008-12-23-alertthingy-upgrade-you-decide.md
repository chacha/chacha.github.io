I am currently sitting in front of 2 monitors and a laptop. On one screen I have Windows Live Writer, and the other screen is equally divided between ‘Alert Thingy v2’ and ‘Alert Thingy for Friendfeed’, while my laptop holds the old version of Alert Thingy. These 3 applications hold most of my entire online presence, all beeping at me every 2 minutes with a nice popup in the lower right hand corner of the screen. These are the tools I use everyday in order to stalk.. err… I mean ‘follow’ you guys. So lets dive right in!

**Display**

Alert Thingy v2 is very clean, bright, and follows the same design as the past clients. Nice rounded edges, big tabs at the top <img style="margin: 0 10px 0 0;" src="http://alertthingy.com/images/screenshots/at2_screenshot_1.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="128" height="250" align="right" />with small buttons for other features at the bottom. The client uses a Blue/White skin and each entry comes with its own set of commands including, Digg, Retweet, Filter, and Reply.

Alert Thingy for Friendfeed however has turned very dark, sporting a Black Theme with white and yellow text making it very unpleasant to read (at least for me). It also still has AlertThingy v1.3 on the top, probably admitting that they barely put any work into this version. And incase you thought that: “Now Chacha, you can simply just go change the skin to something you like”. Your wrong. The ability to change skins has been removed, chaining you to a very dark and annoying skin.

Now, incase you were thinking: “That&#8217;s just the looks, maybe it has some really cool functionality”. I wouldn’t say ‘cool’, but you judge it for yourself.

Alert Thingy v2 comes with support for Digg, Facebook, Flickr, Jaiku, TinyURL, Tumblr, and Twitter. All of which can be set in the ‘settings’ panel and are fed into your large window of awesomeness just like clients before it. Unlike a lot of other clients I’ve seen, you can add in News Articles and RSS feeds to be shown along side your social media. Giving you an alert when the latest Engadget post comes out. And if you want to know what&#8217;s happening on your social networks RIGHT NOW, too bad. You no longer have a ‘Refresh Now’ button.

The Friendfeed version is Friendfeed only. Meaning that you can no longer Tweet or Flickr via Alert Thingy like the old version. You can however shorten URLs with TinyURL, buts that&#8217;s the only non-Friendfeed functionality it contains. And count me as a conspiracy theorist, but it also is having some problems updating.

Oh .. I almost forgot the super cool contacts thing in Alert Thingy v2 that rounds up all of your contacts into one single place. Guess what? It doesn’t do anything after it aggregates it all. It just sits there. According to their website there is ‘awesome new functionality coming to this soon’. If there wasn’t anything ‘awesome’ or ‘functional’ about it now, why include it?

So anyway, I’m going to stop ranting now. Hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com/chacha102" target="_blank">Twitter</a> if you feel like hearing more rants, <a href="http://friendfeed.com/chacha102" target="_blank">Friendfeed</a> if you want to get all my media, or just keep waiting here for me to post something.
