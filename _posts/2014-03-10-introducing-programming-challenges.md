Some of us at [Team 3128](http://team3128.org)Â are trying to solve a problem that students experience with programming. Programming is a trade best learned by addiction and practice. I learned most of my programming skills by doing nothing but for 5 years of my life.

So, we are introducing a way to help students become better programmers. We are introducing the Narwhal Programming Challenge. This is an 8 week program that pushes students to solve problems every week through programming.

Each week starts with a challenge that students must solve and submit before Friday. At the end of the week, we&#8217;ll post up our answer and some tips and tricks you can get out of the challenge.
