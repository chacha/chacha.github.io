Today, [Team 3128](http://team3128.org/)Â launches their [Narwhal Coding Challenge](http://team3128.org/challenge). It is an opportunity for students to grow their programming skills by receiving a challenge each day for 8 weeks that they must solve using code.

What started last year as purely a small idea has now turned into something coming into reality. Sure we haven&#8217;t figure out exactly what the prize is going to be yet. And sure, half of the challenges are only somewhat written out, but today it starts. And as the next 8 weeks go on, we&#8217;ll come up with new challenges and make sure that each week students have something challenging to spend an hour or two on in order to become better programmers.

So come on in and [join us](http://team3128.org/challenge)! Its going to be a fun ride.
