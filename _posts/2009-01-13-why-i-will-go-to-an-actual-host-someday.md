So, I&#8217;m about 4-5 hours into this WordPress nameserver stuff. What happened is that in order for me to have WordPress host my blog, on my domain (chacha102.com), I had to point the domain at WordPress.com nameservers. For people that don&#8217;t know this mumbo jumbo, here is what it means:

  1. I can&#8217;t have email go to anywhere but [Google Apps ](http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html). 
  2. I can&#8217;t create a subdomain (something.chacha102.com)
  3. I can&#8217;t FTP (load files up to the server)

So, these are some big things, that I&#8217;m quickly learning mean that WordPress just screwed me out of $10, AND my domain (for the length I want to keep pointing to WordPress). Because I can&#8217;t create any subdomains, I can&#8217;t hook up a lot of features that Google Apps is built for. If I wanted to, I could add my own custom Google Sites to something like sites.chacha102.com, Google Calendar to, calendar.chacha102.com, and access to the Mail (Uses the Gmail Interface) at mail.chacha102.com. Apps also has a bunch of great other capabilties, and none I can use because WordPress wants me to basically hand over control of my domain (or the records for my domain, I still own it).<!--more-->

And it&#8217;s not just Google Apps that I want this for. OtherInbox allows a great way for me to do my email with my own domain, along with several other things I could set up. I think it would be awesome to make a personal TinyURL script on my domain, that way I wouldn&#8217;t have to rely on the same service as 2,000 other people. Just some ideas.

So, What are my thoughts?  I can add as many as I want to for free at my domain host, and yet WordPress can&#8217;t give me a simple way to edit my CNAME records? I&#8217;m paying WordPress $10/year! Come on&#8230; Shape up your act WordPress. If you are going to take control of my domain, let me manage it aswell.

Got any arguments? I wrote this at 10pm at night so I might be overlooking something. Please coment.
