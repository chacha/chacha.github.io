A robotics camp, to be precise, is what I&#8217;ve being venturing to create over the past few weeks. The students over at [Team 3128](http://team3128.org)Â have came up with an idea to get 5th and 6th graders interested in science and engineering, and from that our Robotics Summer Camp Extravaganza was born.

Ever since I first went to camp in 8th grade I&#8217;ve always wanted to spend time at camp. Its like this magical world where nothing else matters. You get to go up the mountain, away from home, and spend a week transported to a whole different world. The nature, the camaraderie, the field games ending in everyone getting drenched with water. It&#8217;s absolutely life changing.

So, we have a bunch of cool stuff planned. Robots, games, food, all the necessities. We have a good number of volunteers, a good number of weeks, but that hard part is getting the kids. Over the next couple weeks we get to start advertising and talking to parents, hopefully getting around 64 kids to sign up and come have fun with us.

That would just be awesome.
