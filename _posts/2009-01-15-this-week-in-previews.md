Incase anyone was wondering, I haven&#8217;t been able to post recently because of the closing of the first semester at school. With this comes a lot of preperation to get things done as fast as possible. Making me unable to post. But next week is a whole other story. I intend to talk about:

  * My Experience with Google Apps
  * All Email Clients Suck
  * Start Up Apps
  * Google Reader Decimation

So, I hope you all look forward to this week on T&M News. We also are trying to get ideas for weekly video type broadcasts so send me an idea at ideas@chacha102.com if you have a cool video idea that somehow relates to news. If it doesn&#8217;t relate to news, send us an email anyway. Or you can always leave it in the comments.Â 

Currently, I am trying to find more content to put up on the blog. A lot of times I only post every 2 days and I&#8217;m trying to be able to get content out at least once a day. The first thing on that list is I will start to round up content I find interesting and post 3/4 entries on here with my take on it. This will be about once/twice a week, and I will make an effort to keep it short. If you want to see EVERYTHING I find interesting, just go to my [Friendfeed](http://friendfeed.com/chacha102).

Have a great week!
