Many programmers will see this title and laugh. They are right to laugh, because the title promises something that can never be delivered.

All sorts of frameworks are out there. In PHP, there are CodeIgniter, Zend, and countless others all try to be a developer&#8217;s &#8216;go-to&#8217; framework when starting a new project. The problem is: _there isn&#8217;t a one-size fits all framework._ Many people might stare at that last sentence in disbelief. Surely there must be some sort of framework that is flexible enough to conquer all territories?

**There isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all?**

Throughout my short development career, I&#8217;ve quickly learned that no, there isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all development framework. No framework will work in 100% of the problems you are trying to solve.

Now, you might try to say I&#8217;m being conservative. There might not be a framework that covers 100% of all cases, but there simply has to be one that will cover 95-99% of all cases?  I mean, it is never accurate to say that something will _always_ work, but isn&#8217;t there something that will work _most_ of the time?

Well, my friends, there isn&#8217;t a framework out there that will cover 99% of the cases you will encounter. There probably isn&#8217;t even one that will cover 90% of the cases you encounter. There are simply so many different problems out there to be solved, each of them being miles away from each other in terms of context, work flow, and other crucial variables, that you simply can&#8217;t think of all the customizations a user will have to make in advanced. It is just too much to think about!

**What about languages? Can I rely on one to get the job done?**

A language is really a funny concept. Programming languages are really just code written in other languages to interpret a string (your code), and turn it into that languages code. For instance, PHP is written in C. Whenever you run a PHP script, C processes it, and turns it (figuratively) into C code. For you hardcore programmers out there, it doesn&#8217;t actually re-write your code as C. The interpreter simply parses your code and takes actions in C.

Running a PHP script doesn&#8217;t actually stop at C. C was originally written in assembly language. Assembly language is very close to the actual byte code that computers use to process your instructions and actually take actions and make computations.

Now, if you look at PHP, it is really just a framework built in C. Likewise, C is framework built in assembly language, and so on and so forth. And just like all frameworks, languages have a limited scope of problems they are best suited for, depending upon what features are implemented in them. For instance, you wouldn&#8217;t want to write a database in PHP, because PHP isn&#8217;t meant for locating and hold large amounts of data records. Instead, you would use MySQL (another language) for building a database. Likewise, you wouldn&#8217;t want to display HTML content using MySQL.

**Ok, so nothing is perfect. How should I choose what is best for my problem?**

The reason there are so many frameworks and languages out there, is because there are so many different problems that need to be solved. VOIP, instant messaging, email, web surfing, web servers, music streamers, all of these are problems require very different tools to solve. How do you choose the best tool for the job?

This is where experience trumps all. Knowing how to use different tools, and when to use them is perhaps the reason why in the technological field: experience trumps all.

**But that doesn&#8217;t help me&#8230;**

Yeah, it really doesn&#8217;t. But it gives you something to shoot towards. Technology is a constantly evolving industry. To keep on top of it, you should experiment with as many different languages and frameworks as you can, as often as you can, and pick up on what they are good for. Part of that might be reading blogs, finding out what others have used those frameworks for, and talking to experienced programming and trying to gain some of their knowledge.

**Also, there isn&#8217;t always one right way.**

Just as there is no perfect language, there is also no &#8216;correct&#8217; language. You can solve the same problem using a variety of different languages, frameworks, and tools. Twitter was written in Ruby-On-Rails, while Facebook was written in PHP. Both of them are popular, thriving websites that try to solve the problem of connecting you to friends.

**What&#8217;s the take away from all this?**

The take away is fairly simple. Keep learning, keep experimenting, and keep solving problems. The more you do it, the more you love it, the more you will find that you will be able to find the right tools for the job, and the more you will be able to change the world: Solving one problem at a time.
