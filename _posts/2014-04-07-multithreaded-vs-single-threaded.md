> As a human being, you&#8217;re multithreaded. You can type with multiple fingers, you can drive and hold a conversation at the same time. The only blocking function we have to deal with is sneezing, where all current activity must be suspended for the duration of the sneeze. That&#8217;s pretty annoying, especially when you&#8217;re driving and trying to hold a conversation. You don&#8217;t want to write code that&#8217;s sneezy
