[Talent Buddy](http://www.talentbuddy.co/) is a cross-language exercise arena that let&#8217;s you solve problems to programming challenges, as well as see the solutions other&#8217;s post.

The cool thing is that because it features a code emulator, the solutions are more based on programming than the math problems found at Project Euler.
