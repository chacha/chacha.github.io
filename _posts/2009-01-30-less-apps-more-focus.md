So, in reformatting my new computer, I have decided to not use as many applications. One thing I found is that my computer built up a lot of junk over time. That made is very annoying to use, because I had so many applications. Well, this time I am going to install very few applications. I am going to see if I can go ALL Feburary with the same applications that I started with. Here are my guidelines:

<!--more-->

My Categories and Choices: (Unless Stated Otherwise)

&#8211; Browser (2) : Google Chrome and Firefox

&#8211; Tracking App (1): Wakoopa

&#8211; Doc Sync (1): Dropbox

&#8211; IM (1): Pidign

&#8211; Social Media Client (1): Twhirl

&#8211; Music (1): iTunes

&#8211; Notes(1): Evernote

&#8211; Editor(1): Notepadd++

Other Programs that don&#8217;t count: Adobe Air, QuickTime, Adobe Reader, G15 Keyboard Software, Picasa.

Unlike many, I will not install things like Word and Excel, or their OpenSource counterpart, OpenOffice. Adobe Air doesn&#8217;t count, along with hardware software for my G15 keyboard. Viewers like Quicktime, Windows Media Player, and Picasa don&#8217;t count either.

So, that is about 14 programs. Will I be able to survive a month of computing with less than 15 programs? I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;m going to try. Meanwhile, count how many applications of each type you have on your computer. Post the number in the comments.

P.S.: This also serves as a way to review completely those applications. I would also like to disclose that I have a laptop that will not be following these rules simply because A) I never use it, and B) I want to be able to review applications and blog about them.

On Friendfeed, I asked some people what are 5 programs they couldn&#8217;t live without were, here are some of their [suggestions](http://friendfeed.com/e/010c8a2a-5de5-4efb-bddf-b6a6df3645cb/What-are-the-5-applications-you-couldn-t-live/):

  * Firefox
  * Adobe CS3 Suite
  * Office 2007
  * Final Cut
  * Adium
  * Photoshop
  * Digsby
