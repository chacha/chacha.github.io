Millions of people are trying to sell you products everyday that are suppose to make your life easier, more incredible, fantastic, etc. All of them vying for your attention, so that you can spend money on them. Now, I&#8217;m not against the idea of buying a good product. Businesses can only work when there is cash flow. However, the sheer quantity of applications out there is so big that it can be easy to slip into the early-adopter mentality of seeing a new product, and immediately trying it out.

One of the core reasons people are swayed to try out a new product is the hope that it can make their life more interesting, productive, incredible, fantastic. You seen something new, and you don&#8217;t want to miss out on trying it, especially if it is the next Facebook, Google, or Twitter. People that have been around awhile always get the biggest benefit right?

The problem with this mentality is that it creates a large inconsistency in your work flow, and decreases your productivity during each application&#8217;s learning curve. If you are constantly learning the interfaces of different applications, you don&#8217;t have anytime to try to use them to their full potential.

I believe that the early adopter mentality is very much anti-productive. While it might be fun to constantly be trying to next big thing, it is going to decrease the amount of work you get done enormously. So, what is the easiest way to fix this? Commit.

**Committing to an Application**

About a year ago, I committed to using Google Reader, and only Google Reader, as my RSS feed reader. It is constantly open and always has my latest feeds up to date. Before Google Reader, I had tried to quench my thirst for the daily news through a bunch of other news-aggregation sites such as Social Median, News Hub, and a others. However, nothing has worked as well as Google Reader, so I decided to stop trying new applications and simply stick to it.

The quickest way you can gain back lost time from trying new applications is to pick one, and commit. Write it down on a piece of paper, tweet it out to the world, just make it official that you are going to use application X for the next X days. Once you&#8217;ve made the commitment, stick to it. Use your application, learn all the ins and outs of it, and figure out how to make it the best tool for you.

**But what if it doesn&#8217;t work out?**

If your commitment doesn&#8217;t work out, don&#8217;t feel bad switching applications early. Chances are, you aren&#8217;t always going to pick the right application for you the first time. I&#8217;d suggest at least using an application for 2 weeks before deciding whether or not it is right for you. If you decide it isn&#8217;t, try a different application. Your work flow is all about making you as productive as possible, while giving you the information you need to function.

I hope each one of you find the work flow that is right for you. While it is fine to try new things, your schedule will thank your for the consistency.
