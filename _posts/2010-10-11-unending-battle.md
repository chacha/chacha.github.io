_This was an illustrative essay I had to do for school. It was about passing period. It took me awhile to figure out what I was on about coming back to it a couple years later._

The faint murmur of lectures can be heard in the distance, the laughing of students, and slamming of books, the screaming of coaches, the footsteps of runners. But in the center, the air is heavy with silence. Each movement made echos like a bomb, awakening all observers to its occurrence.

The cold, sullen sidewalks glide into a gentle rest as the morning begins. Every once in awhile, a foot or two walks by, awakening each from its sleep. After the disturbance is gone, they slowly fall back to sleep, only to be awakened again in the near future.

The crooked trees shiver as the wind blows across their scattered leaves. They imagine they are warm again, that the time of the year has passed when they will have grown a new coat. Each metal bar lining the walk ways stands at attention, waiting for their time.Â  Each one longing to be held, to be grasped, to be used.

The metal bins crouch with their mouths wide open, like a tiger watching its prey. Each one adorned with different tribal paint, they wait patiently for their mid-day meal of pizza boxes and finished hummus packs.

Suddenly, the morning sun arises. It creeps across the ground ever so slowly, warming each element it touches, reliving them from the cold night they have endured. The entire area seems to relax from its previously tensioned state. Everything is calm.

A warm smell wafts from behind a metal door. Its sweet aroma adding to the atmosphere. As it drifts out, metal doors tighten their grip, hoping to keep the aroma from dancing into the room as long as possible. For the door knows the consequences of this scent, the distraction it brings to be people inside.

As the day moves on, the pavement that was once warmed by the sun has grown hot. As the sun moves across the sky they are shaded once again, allowed to go back into their peaceful state of rest. However, some are not so lucky. They continue to bake in the heat, waiting for their time to rest.

Suddenly, a shrill battle cry rings throughout the ears of the inhabitants of the school. Doors fling open, being slammed against the wall with no regard for its handles surface. Sidewalks tense up as hundreds of feet run across them.

Among the ruckus you can hear cries of glee from the metal bars as students run up and down stairways. And if you watch very closely, you would be able to see as each metal bin snaps up its meal from passing hands. They quickly resume their position, waiting for more meals to come passing by.

As quickly as it began, the commotion ceases. Doors shut themselves tightly. The metal bins slowly chew and digest their food. The bars return to their state of attention. Each mending their wounds, preparing for the next battle.

And as all of this finishes, each pavement brick slowly dozes off to into a quiet sleep.
