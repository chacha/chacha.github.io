Haul out the chop saw.
  
Put on the bumpers before my team spirit falls.
  
Fill up the hopper.
  
I may be rushing things but, put a new battery on!
  
For we need a little robot.
  
Right this very second.
  
Drivers at the joysticks. Coaches yelling louder!
  
Yes we need a little robot.
  
Right this very minute.
  
We haven&#8217;t got a game hint yet, but if we don&#8217;t we regret it.
  
Pull out the team flag,
  
put up the brightest string of LED I&#8217;ve ever seen!
  
Put out some bagels.
  
It time we put up that old wooden goal!
  
For I&#8217;ve grown a little learner,
  
grown a little smarter,
  
grown a little sadder,
  
grown a little older
  
and I need a little inspector,
  
looking at a my robot.
  
I need a little FRC now.
