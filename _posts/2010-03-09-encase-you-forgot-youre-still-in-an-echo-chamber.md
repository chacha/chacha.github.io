The web has too much duplication. And I&#8217;m sick of it. I can open my Google Reader and see 10 articles all talking about the newest Twitter feature, or how start up X is going to revolutionize industry Y. It is simply hideous.

Looking at Techmeme, you can just see how bad it has gotten. Under each of the main articles, you can see a giant list of sites called the discussion list. These are the sites that have written a story on the same subject as the top story. For news sites, being in the discussion list is next to useless. Your name is crowded with a dozen other sites, all talking about the same thing.  As a news site, your goal is to be the main article, and have all those dozens on sites under you. It means both fame and fortune (from ads), plus the possibility to gaining some new loyal readers.

The problem is that the tech news industry is easy. It is really simple to write about whatever happens to become popular on Twitter, and try to get it published and into the nearest aggregator before your competitor. It is easy, and overdone.
