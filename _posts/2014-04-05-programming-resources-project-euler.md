[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net)Â is a great resource to test your ability to problem solve. All of the questions are focused on using programming to calculate numbers and solve problems. The key to it however is really the logic puzzles. You might have problems you think about for a while before you get it, and at a certain point people have found diminishing returns on its usefulness. But, still something to try out.
