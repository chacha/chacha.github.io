That is right. Out of everyone else and all their achievements I win today. Why did I win? I just broke 4,000 views on my blog, and with the recent new post about America&#8217;s Lost Curiousity, while getting some bad comments, pushed me almost to 5,000 views. But that isn&#8217;t the point. Who will win tomorrow?<!--more-->

Every day, people walk around, going through life. Tomorrow you will wake up, you will walk around all day, but do you ever think who won that day? Now, winning might mean a lot of different things to a lot of people. I win when I achieve a goal, when I&#8217;ve been able to do something I want to do. But what happens when you win? Is it the day that you do as much possible for your wife? Do you win when you are able to finally make that last car payment? Or do you win when you finally are able to watch that Office episode everyone is talking about? Do you win when you get that promotion? Or when you finally decide to download Firefox onto your work computer?

Whatever you do tomorrow, wake up tomorrow and ask yourself: &#8220;What will I do that will make me win Today?&#8221;. Whatever it is that makes you win tomorrow, it is something that no one can take away from you. It is special enough to not care about everyone else&#8217;s acomplishments.

So Tomorrow, Win.
