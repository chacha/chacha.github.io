    The fewer people that hear your Tweets, the less you can get feedback from people, and the less that you ask people questions and get responses. It reduces the feeling of being a part of a close community. Jerrel Klaver took this problem and made a community out of it. iFollowBack.com guarantees one thing: you will get followers. Everyone who is a member of iFollowBack must follow 90% of everyone else in the community. This means that as it grows bigger, everyone gets more followers, and everyone wins. <!--more-->

    Using iFollowBack, I’ve found a giant amount of interesting people to follow. Although it might sound like follow a lot of people suddenly, with no filtering, could decrease the quality of your Twitter home page, I found just the opposite. By following so many people, I have increased how many conversations I have because it is easy to weed out people you aren’t interested in.

    The interface is simple. You log in, and it gives you a list of people, with follow buttons. It is easy to follow people directly from there. You just go through all the pages, and suddenly you have a lot of new people you follow. Hopefully, within a few hours, you will also have a few new people following you.

    What do you think about mass following communities?
