I, as well as many people, use Google Reader on a daily basis. Right now, it is my main point of access for reading blogs. But I think that many people aren&#8217;t able to use Google Reader to its full capacity because of the way social features are poorly implemented.

Google just launched the ability to &#8216;comment&#8217; on items after you have shared them. Anyone who can see the Shared Item can also see your comment. But collaborating with other people on Google Reader is somewhat difficult. For a long time, you could share items with other people directly. But this &#8216;friend&#8217; ability required you be friends with them on Google Chat. Setting up the Google Chat friendship is annoying, and you don&#8217;t always want your Google Reader friends having instant access to you on IM.

Google Reader could be very large if it built in features that made it easy to connect with other Google Reader users on blog entries. I think that this approach could shut down a lot of services simply because most social networks are fueled by the sharing of, well, blog entries! Why not skip the in-between from the reader to the service? 

What do you think that Google could add to their RSS Reader?
