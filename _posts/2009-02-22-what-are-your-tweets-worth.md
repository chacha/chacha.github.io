People have been asking what their tweets are worth for a long time. &#8216;How much value do I bring to the people who subscribe to me?&#8217;. You have 140 characters, and those Â characters are what people base whether they listen to you or not. For people not following many people, if they follow you, they expect an actual value out of it. But how do you actually know?

This, I cannot answer. I cannot tell you how to find out if you are providing useful content for people. One thing many people do is follow everyone who follows them. This allows you to see what the people who are listening to you are saying. Things like Twhirl with its expanded @reply finder makes it extremely easy to catch your name anywhere on twitter.Â <!--more-->

I for one, am trying to improve my content. I haven&#8217;t posted much for a while, so I am coming back by posting 5 links a day of interesting stuff I find on the web. I look through plenty of blogs articles, and share Google Reader entries with a bunch of people, I figure I should at least be able to come up with 5 links a day. Not only should this benefit the people following me, it will actually allow my Twitter account to be valuable, to the extent that 140 character messsages can be &#8216;valuable&#8217;.

How will you improve your content today? How will you become a more valuable person on Twitter, Friendfeed, or any other social engine you might be on?

While I am asking questions, how do you find the interesting stuff on the internet. Many people use StumbleUpon, but what other methods or services do you use?
