Due to WordPress and the fact that their stat collecting really stinks, I&#8217;d like to ask: How many of you are out there? How many of you read my blog often and find my content interesting? I think that many authors need to ask this question every so often, because it is a good chance to find out who is visiting your blog?

But in a quick update: Chacha102.com just passed 5,000 total views, which I think is a pretty good milestone. I will probably be switching this over from WordPress.com to a hosted server, and with it will come a Feedburner feed, along with things like a new theme, better statistics, and probably a whole bunch of cool stuff I can&#8217;t think of right now.

So, if you can spare the time, please put your name, blog, and any links you wish in the comments. I&#8217;d love to see your blog, social networks, etc. (I promise, I will write a blog post tomorrow)
