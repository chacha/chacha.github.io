      <em>I wrote this post in March 2009. I still use this concept everyday to break down large tasks into more manageable ones. </em>

      Haha! Tricked you! You thought I was going to lay out a plan on how to kill one of the biggest blogs in the industry. Well, I&#8217;m not. But, I am going to show you a technique you could use to make a plan that would crush the tech news giant. So keep reading.

      Lately I have been listening to Richard Buckland&#8217;s course on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=6B940F08B9773B9F">YouTube</a>. This course covers Higher Computing, and is a fascinating 55 episode lecture from the University of South Wales. In one of these lectures he mentions how working from the Bottom Up is different than the Top Down. When you look at a problem, you generally only look at the big picture. You see that you need to write a 20 page essay on French cuisine, and it seems massive because you are looking at all the different parts that need to go into it. Instead of thinking about writing a 20 page essay on French cuisine, instead try breaking it down into small, manageable chunks that you can individually do to move towards your overarching goal.

    <p>
      Let&#8217;s first pick an action. Let&#8217;s make a blog that is bigger and better than Techcrunch. This seems like a goal that is worth trying to accomplish, and could give a big payoff at the end. Well, we now have this gigantic problem. If you think of this problem in whole, it is really hard. So, the first thing you do is you break down the problem into 2 smaller, more doable steps.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Get More Site Views than Techcrunch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write more Articles than Techcrunch.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      There, we now have 2, smaller steps than the original one. Now we can go have a sundae, take a dive in the pool, and bask in the sun for an hour. Then we come back to the 2 problems and divide each of those into 2 smaller ones.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Get More Site Views than Techcrunch. <ul>
          <li>
            Make a web site
          </li>
          <li>
            Get viewers to come to your site
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Write more Articles than Techcrunch. <ul>
          <li>
            Write 2 Articles for Every Article Techcrunch writes
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep on track of news as often as possible
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Eventually you will get something like this:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Get More Site Views than Techcrunch. <ul>
          <li>
            Make a web site <ul>
              <li>

                      <li>
                        Use Techcrunch&#8217;s Job Board to find a designer
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                  <li>
                    Keep trying new designs and see what works

      Once you get into it far enough, you will have defined easy to do steps that can simplify how you are going to make something bigger than Techcrunch. Then, you simply follow those steps, and eventually the task you wanted to do isn&#8217;t so hard. Try doing the same thing on a blog post. Define what you want to tell your users, then define the 3 major paragraphs, then define what you are going to use in those paragraphs.

      Oh, and if you do make something bigger than Techcrunch, could you send me a check for a million dollars? Or hire me? Please?
