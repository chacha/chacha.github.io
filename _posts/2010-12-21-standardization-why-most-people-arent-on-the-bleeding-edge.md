Everyday there are tons of new technologies that come out that push society as a whole forward. However, many of these new technologies will never see the light of day for years or even decades. Why? Because of a key industry factor: standardization. Standardization is tool that makes parts of products the same across an industry. This ensures that the part is interchangeable and easier to produce.

To understand what standardization is, you have to look at the idea of interchangeability. When two things are interchangeable, you can replace one of them with the other and whatever it was a part of will continue to function. For instance, if two gun triggers are interchangeable, they both will correctly fire a gun when pulled. If you want to read more about interchangeable parts, I&#8217;d suggest learning more on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchangeable_parts).

Standardization is similar to interchangeability. If something is &#8216;standard&#8217;, it means that it is common and expected. Bathrooms are standard in office buildings, and the placement of keys on a keyboard is standard for most keyboards. If something is an &#8216;industry standard&#8217;, like a soda can, it means that companies in a particular industry will make their cans in the same way. This idea of standardization is what allows to type on any keyboard or open any soda can in a similar way, no matter what company the soda or keyboard was made by. This is very useful for the customer, as it reduces the amount of learning involved when they buy a new product.

There is a downside to standardization thought: it takes _time_. SMS messaging was around for a long time before most people were able to use it to message their friends. The Internet started out as a network between different computers in universities or businesses. Eventually these technologies became common to everyone, but it took a long time for them to get there. To become _standard_. This is a problem when new technologies are being invented practically every week. If tomorrow you invented a new method of doing something that was simply brilliant, you still would probably have to wait a year before it started to be practiced in big companies.

Being on the bleeding edge is a double edged sword in business. Depending upon how you use it, you can either better or worsen your position on the industrial playing field. If you use a technology that has unforeseen downsides, you could run into complications and possibly run the risk of loosing tons of money. However, if you use a technology that is highly beneficial, you could sail above your competitors which could lead to increase profits, market share, and more. 

So if you are looking at a brand new technology and wondering why everyone doesn&#8217;t use it, you might want to think hard about the upsides and downsides of the new technology. And if you just happen to develop one, don&#8217;t get discouraged just from the lack of adoption. If it is a good idea, it will get out there.
