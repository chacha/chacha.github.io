Dear Friends and Family,

Thank you so much for your support towards my trip to Honduras this summer. It was so cool to see the things God is doing through us in San Pedro Sula, and it was a lot of fun to be a part of.

This summer we were able to build garden beds for the after-school program that we support, called CDI. The garden beds will help them grow their own food to provide for the kids that visit them everyday to learn about God. We also got a chance to rebuild the bathrooms to make them much sturdier and nicer than they were before.  It was so rewarding being able to leave all the kids with these two awesome gifts that they get to use every day.

Along with those building projects, we got to run a sports camp and vacation bible school all week. Playing with the kids was an awesome experience. One of the days we tried to introduce frisbee to the kids and they just didn&#8217;t get it. They wanted to hoard the frisbee or just didn&#8217;t know what to do with it. After working with them for fifteen or twenty minutes, we were able to get them to pass the frisbee around to eat other and every ended up having a pretty awesome time.

As fun as all of these projects were, the number one reason I loved being able to go to Honduras was longevity. For CDI and many of the kids that go there, churches will come one year and then never come back again. The kids don&#8217;t get to see familiar faces and the adults are always working with new people. Because Grace Point Church has been able to go for three consecutive years, two of which I have been a part of, we have been able to give these kids familiar faces and the knowledge that we are truly partnering with them for the long haul. It is my hope that I will be able to continue going each year to be able to continue to connect with kids and adults and show them God&#8217;s love.

Please keep me in your prayers, along with Grace Point Church, as well as all the awesome people down at CDI in San Pedro Sula. God is really moving in all of us, and it is amazing to be a part of it.
