These are some of my favorite quotes from [West Wing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing). There are many others, but this collection is meant to be funny without the need for extension context. Enjoy. (Watch the show for more&#8230;)

> &#8220;So your policy would allow all citizens to carry concealed weapons?&#8221;
  
> &#8220;Not allow&#8230; Require.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;I just figured out who you were.&#8221;
  
> &#8220;He&#8217;s gonna say Satan.&#8221;
  
> &#8220;No, you&#8217;re the guy that runs into the 7-11 to get Satan a pack of cigarettes. &#8221;
> 
> &#8220;The eagle&#8230; on the seal in the carpet. In one talon he&#8217;s holding arrows and in the other an olive branch. Most of the time, the eagle is facing the olive branch, but when congress declares war, the eagle faces the arrows&#8230; How do they do that? You think they&#8217;ve got a second carpet sitting around in the basement someplace?&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;They sent me two turkeys. The most photo-friendly of the two gets a Presidential pardon and a full life at a children&#8217;s zoo. The runner-up gets eaten.&#8221;
  
> &#8220;If the Oscars were like that, I&#8217;d watch.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;You just spent six billion dollars on health care. How do you feel?&#8221;
  
> &#8220;I&#8217;d feel better if it meant just once I could go to a doctor without filling out something on a clipboard.&#8221;
> 
> &#8220;There is no group of people this large in the world that can keep a secret. I find it comforting. It&#8217;s how I know for sure that the government isn&#8217;t covering up aliens in New Mexico.&#8221;
