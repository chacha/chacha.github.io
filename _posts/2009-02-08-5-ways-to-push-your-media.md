One question I stumbled onto this week, is where am I sending my content to? I know I&#8217;m sending it to Friendfeed, Twitter, SocialMedian, but where <span style="text-decoration:underline">should</span> I be sending it to? And <span style="text-decoration:underline">how</span> should I be sending it? What are the best practices to make sure that my content is know, without being labeled a spammer?

Here comes list time!

1) Twitter and Friendfeed it.

This is the obvious choice. Everyone uses Twitter, and many use Friendfeed. Most of you probably even have the RSS feed piping into either/both. If you have it piping into Twitter, mention it more personally in a few hours. You can even say things like &#8216;Lot of interest on my post about Humans killing aliens. http://link.y/link.&#8217;, or other things like that.

Friendfeed is another story. Because of hiding, many people don&#8217;t see Blog posts. If you do blog posts in quick succession, you have the risk of them being clumped together. Also, they don&#8217;t look as read-worthy because Friendfeed doesn&#8217;t pipe in pictures with your RSS feed. Use the Bookmarklet to select a picture on your post, make a quick comment, and if their is fat on your Title (Like the &#8216;<<T&M News&#8217; on &#8216;I like Trees <<T&M News&#8217;), make sure to trim it down. Most people also look at Friendfeed internal messages more frequently than blog entries.

2) Send it to Digg, SocialMedian, etc

Everyone should send things to these sites. There is always a chance that you will get a lot of diggs, clips, or whatever the currency is. But,Â his is annoying one. By sending it to all of these sites, it means either going to a lot of sites separately, or going through a lot of bookmarks. Most of the time not all of the sites will grant you a lot of traffic, but it is good to get them all out there. Try putting all of them into a bookmarking folder, and then go through them one by one. Who knows what could happen?

3) Use tracking seriously

Look at your statistics for the first 10 minutes after you post something on Twitter or Friendfeed. Watch both your blogs stats, and who are responding to your posts. One thing is that after the first 10 minutes, unless people are retweeting your posts, most of the people who go to your blog via that tweet will have already clicked it. In those 10 minutes, you can watch to see how many people click on your links.

Seeing how many people click on your links is very valuable information. If a lot of people trust you as a reliable news source, you should be more sparing with your links. On the other side, if not many people go to your links, you might want to try to improve that. Now you can&#8217;t make people click your links, but you can expand the things you link. If people find your links interesting, they will come back for more. One of those links will probably be towards your blog

4) Find the niche aggregators

Finding the aggregators that aren&#8217;t as well known, but extremely relevant to your blog, is a very powerful tool. Because they aren&#8217;t as well known, it means you won&#8217;t have a ton of competition for the front page. Yes, you will have to compete with the other blogs in your niche, but then it becomes more about the content, instead of being a powerhouse.

5) Push it while relevant

Many people find that you should publish it once, and if people find it, they find it. One of the things about the real time web is there is so much data going around, people are going to miss things. If you push that content again in 2 days, there is a bigger chance that they will find it. The big line here is not to spam. Posting about your article every hour is going to get you blocked, hidden, or something else equally bad. Once a day is a good place to start. If you post it a second day, try to post it at a significantly different time. If you posted one at 8pm, try putting it out at noon.

Â 

The last, and most heard comment on every single one of these lists is: Nothing can substitute for great content. You have to actually post things people want to read in order for them to read it.
