It was 8:47, and all through the chat&#8230;
  
Not a member was stirring&#8230; not even one with a hat.
  
The snow was falling outside ever so gently
  
And the San Diego sun was keeping it meltily

Why if you were awake, what silence you could hear!
  
Except the sound of a doge machine, spinning with cheer.
  
And I in my vest, and my iPad on its stand, had just settled in for some rounds of Pacman.

And then suddenly, out of the window my eyes saw a blurr!
  
It was fast! It was big! It was covered in fur!
  
So I rushed to the window, I flung open the drapes! and what to my wondering eyes did amaze?
  
But a great large fellow led by 8 FRC bots. Each one blinking with lights that don&#8217;t sync up alot.

Each bot was made perfect for its own unique function.
  
Ping-pong paddles and plungers and tubes that had suction!

Their wheels glowed with magic as they soared through the sky,
  
They whizzed with great lift, and no one quite knew just why,
  
A wheel might propelled such as load through the air,
  
But at the moment we speak of I just didn&#8217;t care.

But my gaze met the person at the end of them all,
  
Surrounded by joysticks, kinects, switches and balls.
  
And his task, so intense, his face filled with zen,
  
that only one of six screens was playingÂ Frozen.
  
And I looked at his beard, and I knew it was him,
  
The one they had fabled, the RoboGarrison!

They had called him a myth! They had said &#8220;It ain&#8217;t true!&#8221;
  
But now all of them can go sit in a stew,
  
Because right as he rushed by my window, you see
  
I glanced at his laptop, I looked at his screen.

And as surely as the moon is less small than a match,
  
I saw a sure sight, that not one could hatch,
  
As surely as the best stuff on earth&#8217;s in a Snapple,
  
By golly, the RoboGarrison was using an Apple.

I was shocked! I was flabbergasted! I felt tricked and bamboozled!
  
I had to have been misenflabbermanjoogled!
  
But I took one more looked, and I knew it was true&#8230;
  
His screens were all apples, except maybe two.

And with this grim sight I walked back to my bed,
  
And with a sad thought stuck in my head,
  
I fell off to sleep, I wondered no more,
  
For I knew that I trusted RoboGarrison no more&#8230;
