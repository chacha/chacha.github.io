I recently began reading RSS feeds again. I&#8217;ve had an on and off relationship with them. On one hand, knowing what is happening in the world and having access to cool content is a great perk that technology allows. On the other hand, it takes time away from work and real-life human interactions with people I care about, as well as can be a distraction from putting my mind towards passions. However, if used correctly it can keep me more generally informed about the world around me as well as serve as a booster to bolster my passions.

So, the plan is simple: as much content as possible in the most efficient means possible. Get through lots of content in short amounts of time so I can get back to what I was doing. How do I do this?

**Curated Categories**

The only categories I have on my reader are ones I sincerely care about: cooking, Christianity, productivity, entrepreneurship, FIRST, and WordPress. I refuse to have a &#8216;techology&#8217; category, a &#8216;writing&#8217; category, or any other category that doesn&#8217;t directly pertain to my interests. Furthermore, inside each of these categories I only have feeds that give me the full content of the blog post in my feed reader. I am not very interested on a normal basis of going to an outside site to get my content. I want 80% of my reading done in the feed reader. However there are some exceptions&#8230;.

**Title-only Firehose Categories**

Besides my regular categories, I have a couple &#8216;firehose&#8217; categories. These are categories that are specifically set up for me to scan over a fairly large number of titles quickly for topics that interest me. They contain high volume feeds that I can quickly filter through and discard most of. These include things like the Hacker News feed, Techmeme, and any other general blog I want to follow that doesn&#8217;t pertain to my stated interests. Because these feeds will ultimately make up of a small percentage of my actual reading, they can require me to go through to the website to read. I&#8217;m only looking at the title most of the time anyway.
