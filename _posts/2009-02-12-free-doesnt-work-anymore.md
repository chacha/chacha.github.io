One of the topics going around the web is this idea of Micropayments. The idea that you could have easy ways for people to transfer small bits of money over the internet. Would you be willing to pay 1 cent to read this blog post? Would you be willing to pay 3 cents every day that you use certain web applications? Even after a month, you wouldn&#8217;t even have Â paid a buck. Over a year? $11 for this one simple web application that you use alot. Plus, it is beneficial because if you don&#8217;t use an app a certain day, your cost goes down.Â

[Alex Wilhelm](http://www.alexwilhelm.com/alex_wilhelm/2009/02/mircopayments-is-it-time.html) spurred this idea that Micropayments should be put in place to allow for both easy viewing of blogs, but also allow for a stream of revenue from those bloggers. If enough people came to a blog, it would off set the cost. 3 people coming every day for a year at 1 cent a day would cover the amount I pay for linking my WordPress Blog to my account.

Here is an except:

> &#8220;There is no real way to make all parties happy. Producers need money, and consumers do not want to give it up. Can micropayments bridge that gap in some way? Yes, and here is how:

>   Any micropayment system that would be implemented would need to be flexible enough to work across several platforms. Therefore, the one that I use to access selected content on the New York Times should work on ArsTechnica the same way it works on TechCrunch. Anything short of that will make it unpalatable to consumers, and thus stillborn.

Nothing to the user, they would run up a bill of less than ten dollars over a month. Ten dollars a month for amazing, internet wide content? I&#8217;ll signup for that deal. Works for me. People need to eat, that involves money, so throw them a bone.&#8221; &#8211; Alex Wilhelm

  One thing people struggle a lot with, and more and more start ups have been trying to come up[ with solutions for, is a way to get bloggers money without turning away readers. Many people use adsense, and while that is all fun and dandy, Ad Block is very easy to install and use. What if you didn&#8217;t have to use it? What if blogs could simply make money by charging each user 1 cent to read and article? I think too many people have this idea set on everything should be free.
</div>

<div>
  Free is a very special number in our heads. People who do studies made a test where they put up $5 items for sale online. To some people, they sold the product fo $5 and no shipping. Others they sold the items for $2.50, and $2.50 for shipping. Still others, they made the product Free, and had $5 shipping. The one where the product was Free, and it had $5 shipping sold greatly over the rest.Â 
</div>

<div>
  The idea that something has no detrement is a very powerful one. This is a tatic used by many start-ups. They offer the product for free, and then they get a lot of people into it. But that fact is that people who produce things need money. That is why in the study, they still sold everything for $5. Everything still had a cost, because they still need to make money. Most blogs you read still have a cost to you. They cost you valuable space by placing ads, and something biased opinions because of sponsors. What if you could get rid of that by instead, paying 1 cent to read their post?
</div>

<div>
  I&#8217;m not saying ads would completely go away. At least for new bloggers, you might need to make more money per view in order to keep it running. But Techcrunch has become loaded with ads, and other similar sites has also needed to make money. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better if they simply charged you a cent for every X number of blog post reads? You could cut out a lot of the things that possibly deter the blog from giving the best content available.Â

  Would you pay 1 cent for great content?
