**Week One: Summing the Fibonacci Sequence**
  
Tyler Carter

This challenge is designed to get you into thinking about solving problems through code.

A Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers created by adding the sums of the previous two numbers. For instance, if you start with 1 and 2, your next number will be three. For first 10 terms would be:

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
    

If you added these first 10 terms `(1+2+3+5+8+13+21+34+55+89)` you would get a sum of 231.

Your first challenge is to write a program that will give you the sum of every odd number in the Fibonacci sequence under 10 million.
