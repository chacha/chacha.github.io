Any blogger is painfully aware that to grow traffic you have to make a front page somewhere. When bloggers come together they wistfully talk of that one day they got Dugg by accident. Traffic exploded, the server nearly melted, but the people just poured in. They kept coming and coming, seemingly endless. Who knew there were so many people on the internet? A few cups of over-priced coffee later, someone will state a pact that everyone should upvote each others stories. Heads nod.<!--more-->

 <span></span>What happens then? Well, we have all been there, nothing happens. People go home and write away, wishing for more traffic. Hoping for more comments. More anything, really. In all honesty, for the small blogger, it can be a little depressing at times. This needs to change. We need an increased number of social news websites where smaller bloggers have a chance to be heard. We need to as a collective group, add a few more blogs onto our RSS reader. We need to take that extra minute to leave a comment.

 <span></span>But more so, we need to find a new way to distribute the power. Mega-blogs and the like are too powerful, they have to much control over the news. We need new micro networks to come forward and bring their perspective to the forefront. We need to reform the internet.

 <span></span>What I am advocating here is the birth of a thousand new blogging networks, and a hundred new social news sites. There are enough people on the internet to support new aggregation. We need to let small voices be heard, and right now, you cannot hear them. Long live the blogger.
