So, the Superbowl has once again came and passed, and I am sure that all of you you were glued to the TV. Except those who proudly decreed on Friendfeed and Twitter that you were NOT watching the Superbowl. Whether you watched it or not, everyone has something to gain from it. The entertainment that is the Superbowl Ads.

Hulu put on a special event for Superbowl 2009. They updated their website during the game with all the ads. Well, unfortunately the really under delivered, and many of the ads seen on TV weren’t even on the site for a while. But, it was still a great place to watch the ads. You can find all the ads [here](http://www.hulu.com/superbowl).

But back to more relevant, and ego inducing things. What were MY favorite ads?<!--more-->

WordPress.com However does not know how to post Hulu Videos, so I&#8217;ll try to replace them all on YouTube. Seriously WordPress, get with the times.

  1. The Hyundai Commercials
  
    I generally like Hyundai commercials because of the narrator, and these two definitely played on that. The first one starts out with an assistant bringing a newspaper to his boss saying that Hyundai has won an award. Then it goes showing other car manufactures yelling in anger the name ‘Hyundai’, but the rest of the words were in different languages. The best part is when it cuts to the “Hyundai won X award” screen, and the narrator comes on and says “You win one little award, and everyone suddenly gets your name right Its Hyundai, like Sunday.” <div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">

    </div> 

  2. The Second one teases the Genesis Coupe, the upgrade to the Genesis which was named 2009 North American Car of the Year. The best part of the commercials are the sarcasm, which this one also uses. <div id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:3bcfdd66-6f7d-4e74-8988-af40c115bf6a" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" style="float:none;margin:0;padding:0">
      <div>
        <div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
          <span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'></span>
        </div>
        
        <br />  
      </div>
    </div>

  3. The Roadies Sprint Commercial
  
    You might have seen this before, but it is basically a bunch of roadies using the Sprint Direct Connect feature to make their phones like walkie-talkies. If every flight began this way, and there were bigger windows in the plane to watch it through, I’d fly more.<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">
      <span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'></span>
    </div>

  4. Hulu, an evil plot to destroy the world.
  
    Hulu did a very funny commercial of your brain rotting because of TV, and then rotting more because you can watch it wherever via Hulu. Funny enough, the videos I am showing you are from Hulu.

    So, those are my picks. You can see the Consumerists Live Blog of the evening [here](http://consumerist.com/5143895/consumerists-super-bowl-ad-liveblog). Hulu has all of the videos [here](http://www.hulu.com/superbowl/), and so does CastTV [here](http://www.casttv.com/superbowl-commercials). I hope you enjoyed the evening. I left 30 minutes before it was all over and went to Black Angus for prime rib. Given it was Superbowl Sunday, there wasn’t many people there. If you were disappointed in the ads, remember that none of the American Car Companies could make ads without being pointed out for spending bailout money on it.
