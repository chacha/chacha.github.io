Sorry to disappoint, but I am going to skip posting today so that I can prepare for content tomorrow. If you really wan&#8217;t to find my stuff, check out my Twitter account (http://twitter.com/chacha102). I also, constantly post things to my [Google Reader Shared](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/05031209229858543935) items. 

Don&#8217;t worry though. Tomorrow I will get you caught up with a great amount of information with a ton of links. I hope to do a giant blog post of links once a week. 

Also, please take this time to check out the aggregation of NextTech&#8217;s blogs at thenextintech.com. NextTech is a group of young blogger that collaborate together. They provide hosting for this blog and I couldn&#8217;t do what I do without them.

If you would like to guest post on T&M News, email me at chacha@chacha102.com. 

Will see you tomorrow!
