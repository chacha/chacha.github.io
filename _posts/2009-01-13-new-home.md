This holiday season I bought myself a domain name. For a few months, I&#8217;ve been deciding whether to give up my domain name servers to WordPress in order to get my blog hooked up. Well, I finally decided that being able to use OtherInbox for my mail was less important than establishing myself on Chacha102.com, so I bit the bullet and now our new home is : Chacha102.com. I figure it was best to switch us before we were that well established.Â 

By the way, we just hit 1,000 views in total. Not that big of an accomplishment, but one none the less. One thing I find strange is that 1/3 of the hits everyday come from people searching for &#8216;Motivational Posters&#8217; on Google. I don&#8217;t get it, but obviously I am a authority on motivational posters, after only one mere post about them. Who would have guessed?

So, Chacha102.com lives! No, I will not explain the T&M part.
