<span style="font-weight: normal">The first step to managing and sorting through your Twitter list is finding people to follow. Depending on how much information you want to receive, you can place your limit on how many people you actually want to follow. Here are some services to help you get started.</span>

## iFollowBack.com

One of the first tools to find people to follow that I would recommend is iFollowBack. Everyone who signs up is required to follow 90% of everyone else on the site, so you are almost guaranteed that it will increase your audience. It is really simple to go through and follow a large amount of people, and I have made a good number of friends from the service. Simply sign up, and start following. Each page has 20 users on it, all with &#8216;follow&#8217; buttons that allow you to follow them directly from the page. 

## Twollow

The other way that I find people to follow is by having Twollow, a passive following engine that follows people based on keywords, run in the background. I just pick some keywords I am interested in, and Twollow will follow up to 15 people a day that talk about those keywords. I especially like Twollow because it fills up the real estate that I don&#8217;t. If I am only following 1,900, it will pop the number up to 2,000 and keep me at my max.

## TwitterKarma

The last of the weird named tools that I use is called TwitterKarma. It basically allows you to do large tasks of following/unfollowing people. I simply enter in my user name, sort by who is following me, but I&#8217;m not following them, and do a bulk follow. This allows me to follow everyone who is following me, because they are the people most likely to respond to me and create a conversation.

Tomorrow, We will focus on how to manage the people you follow, and sort through them to get the active ones.
