January, The second month of http://chacha102.com. Let&#8217;s see first how it went for us, and then highlight some posts, and then I&#8217;ll point out some cool articles I just recently found.

**Stats**

Total Views: 1,507

Busiest Day: 119, Tuesday, December 30th, 2008

Busiest Day in January: 87, January 23rd, 2009 (When I posted &#8220;[Anyone use Twitter Favorites?](http://chacha102.com/2009/01/19/anyone-use-twitter-favorites/)&#8220;)

Average Views per Day: 38

Preceding Months Views: 354

Current Months Views: 1,153

Percent Increase: 325.70%

Overall, more views, probably because I post more and some people actually know about the site. But, in order to increase the awareness that I do infact have a blog, I will begin posting these stories to Twitter. I have been forgetting to do that, but it is probably my biggest outlet, with 400+ followers. Just a note: Everything is also fed through Friendfeed, and into my FF Twitter account: http://twitter.com/tandmnews

**Posts**

_These are a collection of the most popular posts on the blog this month. Or what I consider to be important._

### [I Got Your Motivation Right Here&#8230;.](http://tandmnews.wordpress.com/2008/12/31/i-got-your-motivation-right-here/)

This was, for some reason, the most popular post in the last 30 days, with 311 views. Why did it get so popular? Mainly because people searched Google for things like &#8220;funny motivational posters&#8221; and etc, and ended up coming to my blog. I looked, and found that I was like the 30th page. Some people really like those motivational posters..

### [Anyone use Twitter Favorites?](http://tandmnews.wordpress.com/2009/01/19/anyone-use-twitter-favorites/)

This idea, sparked by Devon Campbell, gave a simple way how to hook up Twitter Favorites with Friendfeed, that way you can import all those tweets you really like, and have them show up on your FF Feed.

### [Lists of Friends and Lists of Feeds](http://tandmnews.wordpress.com/2008/12/29/lists-of-friends-and-lists-of-feeds/)

This one might not have been published in January, but I would still like to point it out. In here I describe how each Friendfeed user can be stereotyped by the type of content the primarily share, and then sorted into groups. It might not be a task for the intention span lacking, but it can definitely be done.

### Other Peoples&#8217; Posts

_Here I will outline some interesting posts from other people._ 

### [<span>Google launches Measurement Lab to monitor the tubes, expose meddling</span>](http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/29/google-launches-measurement-lab-to-monitor-the-tubes-expose-med/) {.posttitle}

<p class="posttitle">
  Google recently is supporting an effort to create Internet measuring tools that will allow people to find out whether their Internet is being slowed. This is a major step in making sure users know whether or not the ISP they are with is trying to go against Net Neutrality.

### [Newegg actually replaces your defective keyboard.](http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/consumerist/full/~3/1lX7fY2bYJk/newegg-shocks-the-hell-out-of-you-by-replacing-your-defective-keyboard)

I really applaud Newegg here for doing the right thing and giving the guy a new keyboard. Not only is it great publicity for them with this Consuermist Story, it doesn&#8217;t cost that much to replace a keyboard compared to losing a customer.

### [Ten Years of Google](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/01/ten-years-of-google-video.html)

This video shows 10 years of Google Products, and is really cool. It shows as each product comes into market, and when they did. Brings back the memories of some old services as well.

### [Twitter puts limits on API calls, even for whitelisted applications](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/webware/~3/519222115/8301-17939_109-10147535-2.html)

Twitter has maxed out the number of API calls, even for white listed applications that do many calls every hour. This limit is 20,000, and many people are complaining about it because Twitter applications can no longer grow. Twitter really needs to shape up its act, or there just aren&#8217;t going to be people developing for it. Think if all these Twitter developers went to develop for Friendfeed.
