Before Christ, I was a **different** person.
  
That person was my old nature. My old self.
  
But that person has **died**. And my life is now hidden. With Christ.  
  
I am in Christ. And **He** is in me.  

I am a new creation.  
That doesn't mean that I will never stumble, or fall back into old patterns.  
But I will call them what they are: old patterns, old habits of the old person.  
  
I will confess them. I will thank God for this forgiveness. I will make amends.  
And then, I will **move on**.  
  
Not because I am taking Sin lightly.  
But because **I am** taking serious who God says I am: holy, pure, untained, without blemish.
  
Not because of anything I've done. But because of what God has done for me.  
  
He has wiped my slate clean. I am blameless before Him. Therefore, shame has no place in my life.   
Because I am a new creation.  
  
And all of the ugly parts of my story, the parts that I want to pretend never happened.  
They have been redeemed.  
They have become the moments of my life when God's grace is most on display.  
  
Thank You God  
  
For my mistakes do not define me.
My past does not define me.  
  
Because God has defined my identity:  
  
I am his beloved child,  
In whom he is well pleasd.
