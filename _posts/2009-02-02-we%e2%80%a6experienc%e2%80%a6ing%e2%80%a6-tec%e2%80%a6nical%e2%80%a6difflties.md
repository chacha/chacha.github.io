We have experienced some technical difficulties alongside the launch of SocialWhois, and our post about them. For a short period of time we had to change the theme of our site to something that better coped with the layouts of certain posts. The main theme is back now, and if you want to find out the exact story, click through to read it. Otherwise, enjoy reading Chacha102.com.

SocialWhois launched about a month or two ago, when 21 people were invited into a Friendfeed room, which was the basis for communication on the app. We’ve been testing and improving the app since then, and launched today. Unfortunately, SocialWhois launched in the middle of my Debate class, and I only had my iPod touch with me. Trying to post my review up, I had forgotten to put the little ‘more’ attribute, which limits the article on the front page to about a paragraph. Without this tag, the front page becomes distorted. Well, after trying several things, I could not get that ‘more’ tag in under there, as I had also forgotten with my previous post. This led me to decide to change the theme for a little over 4 hours.

Now that I have told you more than you wanted to know about my day today, lets get on with the upcoming posts.

  * The Complete Guide to Windows 7 (After You’ve installed it)
  * Gmail Tasks Updated
  * What Google really needs on the iPhone

_The Complete Guide to Windows 7_ will outline about everything I can think of that I have used in Windows 7, along with the quirks and improvements I think should be made. __I will be launching a new part of this site called&#8217; ‘Pages’, which will contain large articles that outline a lot of things, like the Guide to Windows 7, for instance. I will also release an update guide to the Release Candidate, and the Full Version.

Have a great week!
