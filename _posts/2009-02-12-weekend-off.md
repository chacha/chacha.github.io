Just wanted to give you all a heads up, I will be off for the next 4 days skiing. Except there will probably be more JacuzzingÂ (Is that how you spel Jacuzzi? ). None the less, Alex Wilhelm from [alexwilhelm.com](http://alexwilhelm.com), and Holden Page from [lostthetech.com](http://lostthetech.com) will be guest posting in the next 4 days. I trust that they will give you interesting content. Please also take this time to go over past posts like my [Complete Guide to Windows 7,](http://tandmnews.wordpress.com/2009/02/07/a-preview-to-the-complete-guide-to-windows-7-2/)Â [25 things you didn&#8217;t know about me,Â ](http://chacha102.com/2009/01/19/25-things-about-you-and-me/)Â and how I suggest listing your friends on [Friendfeed](http://chacha102.com/2008/12/29/lists-of-friends-and-lists-of-feeds/).Â 

Until Tuesday,
