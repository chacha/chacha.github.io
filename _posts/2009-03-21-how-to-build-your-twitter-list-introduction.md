Many times, we have a lot of things to say about a certain subject. This often results in really long and annoying posts because everyone has more sites to visit, more articles to read, and more things to do! In order to help you all out in digesting this information, I’ve decide that in order to address large topics, I will go to the tactic used by my local pastor: Series. 

Basically, over the few weeks, you will see a series of topics regarding the topic ‘Building Your Twitter List’. All of these will relate to the subject on how to build your Twitter list, and then will be compiled into a single page, and ‘something’ will be done with it. Most likely it will be posted as a single, giant, guide for everyone to see. 

“BUT I DON’T WANT TO WAIT!!!”

I realize that some people are impatient and don’t want to wait for all of this knowledge. So each series will have its own Google Document with all the sections of the series in one place, for all to view. There is a drawback to this. The document will only show as much as I have written up to the point. It might show more than posted on the site, but I can only write so fast. In this case, the <a title="Building Your Twitter List" href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dcw5kx6f_38fpgznqht" target="_blank">"Building Your Twitter List"</a> can be located <a title="Building Your Twitter List" href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dcw5kx6f_38fpgznqht" target="_blank">here</a>.

So, lets begin the series with some simple ‘meta’ information about it. Tomorrow the first informational post will go live.

## Introduction

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This series "How to build your Twitter List" will be a multiple part series on how to build your list of people you follow on Twitter. It will cover how to build and maintain the people you follow on Twitter. This is simply <u>different</u> ways you could maintain a large list of people, and general rules of following/unfollowing large amounts of people. You may not agree with all the techniques, and if you don&#8217;t, simply don&#8217;t use them. Some methods might work for certain people, and Twitter isn&#8217;t a one size fits all type of service. 

&#160;&#160;&#160; This entire series is closely tied with my giant analysis titled &#8216;Untitled&#8217; that looks at how Social Media was created and how it affects modern day society.

## Golden Rule: Friends don&#8217;t count and this isn&#8217;t Personal

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Throughout this entire guide, remember that anyone you are particularly interested in, having relationships with, or is basically not a general stranger, doesn&#8217;t count. The people you actually have a relationship with shouldn&#8217;t be unfollowed, ever. I will be dealing with rules that entail up to 2,000 people, so don&#8217;t let the important ones gets lost into the crowd.

&#160;&#160;&#160; Although it might be hypocritical to be going into a Social Network and treat accounts as simply on/off switches, the fact is that it is very hard to manage a large amount of connections that aren&#8217;t really personal. If you don&#8217;t like following people you don&#8217;t have a personal connection with, this guide isn&#8217;t for you. I am trying to get the most value out of Twitter I can by being able to get a large, diverse following, while still keeping my personal connections intact. 

&#160;

I hope you enjoy this series of posts, and I can’t wait to see you tomorrow!
