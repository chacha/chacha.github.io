One journey that many companies embark on is the quest to sync documents between different computers, and increasingly the web. Microsoft has tried it with Live Mesh, allowing you to have 5GB of storage online, and sync folders between your computers. Live Mesh is actually unique in the fact that it allows you to sync folders only to computers, allowing big iTunes libraries to be synced with ease. Dropbox, another syncing company, creates a box that allows you to share 2GB with the web for free, and 50GB without. While both of the options are fine, I think a lot of them have missed what syncing really needs. _The ability to match the syncing to your workflow._

Many people work with different folders and file types, and not all of them need to be synced. On either Live Mesh or Dropbox, anything you put in there is synced. There is no logic to tell people that pictures should be synced, and music files shouldn&#8217;t. This type of rules could also be applied to size. If there is a video that takes up half a gig, I really don&#8217;t want to sync it to a 2GB storage space.

The next problem is folders. Dropbox only allows you to sync one single folder, with multiple ones inside of it. I think that makes it very limited because you have to make sure anything that is going to be synced goes there. Don&#8217;t get the problem? If you are a Gmail user, you should recognize it immediatly. You only want 1 copy of a item (file or email), because have multiple copies takes up space. It would be better if A) I could assign specific files to be synced (right click, &#8216;Sync this File&#8217;) and B) Assign specific folder(s) to be synced. By the way, Live Mesh does allow me to assign folders to be synced, I didn&#8217;t miss it.

The reason behind both of these things is the fact that this entire thing needs to countour to your work flow. If I have a My Pictures folder, I don&#8217;t want to have to remeber to move everything to the My Dropbox > My Pictures Folder. Likewise, I don&#8217;t want to have to move something from a specific spot on my hard drive to a My Dropbox folder, because then I have to remeber to put it back. Too much time/energy/remebering.

Lastly, it needs to happen seamlessly. Many people already know that Dropbox and Live Mesh do all of this stuff very seamlessly and in the background. But I just want to make it clear that if it isn&#8217;t easy to use, people won&#8217;t adopt it. You need to make it easy enough that it could be applied to an entire school district, and no one would really have much to complain about. I guarentee that if that happens, almost anyone could use it.

And one more thing, you need to be able to break the rules. I might tell my syncing program to sync every file in this folder, but I also need to be able to right click on something and say &#8220;Do Not Sync&#8221;, or I need to be able to click on a file in a non-synced folder on my computer and say &#8220;Sync This&#8221;.Â
