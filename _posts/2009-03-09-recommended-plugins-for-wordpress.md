Going along with my ‘Recommended Themes for WordPress’, I’d like to post some of the Plugins I recommend for WordPress. Once again, you should be able to search in your Google Reader for ‘Wordpress Plugins’, and you will probably find a lot of results. I also recommend WP Hack’s <a href="http://wphacks.com/wordpress-plugins/" target="_blank">‘Ulimate WordPress Plugin List’</a>

**<a href="http://akismet.com/" target="_blank">Akismet</a>**

Although it requires a WordPress.com API key to use, Akismet is a great way to get rid of spam comments. It is provided by default in WordPress installs, and I suggest you turn it on. Just make sure to check the spam qeue before deleting it all, as it might have accidentally marked a good comment as spam.

<a href="http://semperfiwebdesign.com/" target="_blank">All in One SEO Pack</a>

This plugin takes care of formatting pages for you, and optimizes what you need to show up in search engines like Google. Just remember to check for updates, because it updates often.

<a href="http://getclicky.com/goodies/" target="_blank">Clicky Web Analytics</a>

GetClicky is the website we use for website analytics. It offers great tracking, even for free. 

<a href="http://flagrantdisregard.com/feedburner/" target="_blank">FD Feedburner Plugin</a>

In order to redirect all of your feeds over to Feedburner, I suggest getting a plugin that makes sure they are sent over. FD Feedburner makes sure that even if a visitors tries to use the direct WordPress feed, it redirects to Feedburner.

<a href="http://cavemonkey50.com/code/google-analyticator/" target="_blank">Google Analyticator</a>

At NextTech, we use 2 stat providers, just incase. The one that we don’t have to pay for is Google Anayltics, which allows us to easily make custom reports and share data. I highly recommend using it for stats. The Google Analyticator simply makes it easy to customize what stats show up in Google Stats

<a href="http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/wordpress-plugins/theme-test-drive" target="_blank">Theme Test Drive</a>

Especially when trying out new themes, you don’t want all your visitors looking at your theme until you have fine tuned it. Use Theme Test Drive so administrators can see the theme before you make it go live, and test drive it completely.

<a href="http://www.mashget.com/2008/09/10/wp-more-feeds-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">WP More Feeds</a>

Some times you want to advertise feeds for particular categories or feeds. WP More Feeds allows you to do just that, making it easy for users to subscribe to smaller sections of the website.

<a href="http://www.joedolson.com/articles/wp-to-twitter/" target="_blank">WP to Twitter</a>

If you forget to post your latest blog post to Twitter, never fear. Let to Twitter handle it for you. You can set it up to post your new blog post to Twitter exactly when you press publish. It also works with scheduled posts, making pre-writing your posts very easy.

<a href="http://bravenewcode.com/wptouch/" target="_blank">WPTouch</a>

As more people become mobile, they want your content to become mobile as well. Give them a 1 step solution by using WP Touch and whenever an iPhone hits your website, it is easy for them to navigate it. 

I hope I helped you get your install of WordPress more customized! Have fun blogging
