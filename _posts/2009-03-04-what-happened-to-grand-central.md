I use my phone on a daily basis, as does everyone. Often the phone is the central means of communication for companies, families, and just people in general. The phone is one of the most used inventions in human history, because it is simple and useful. You call someone, they answer, or it goes to voicemail. While many people argue there are ways to improve phone calling, the basic features are still very prominent. Google has their answer to phone calling using Grand Central, but when was the last time we heard from them?

Currently the service has not received an update on its blog since April 22, 2008, and is not allowing existing users to invite new users. I don&#8217;t know if they are adding people to the service, but still the service has seemingly been put on the back burner for awhile.

I think that Google has done some really cool things with Grand Central. You can switch between 2 phones while on call. You have visual voicemail, and several other great features. But can Google innovate any more? People have posted how no one wants to listen to voicemail, and how they would prefer email to phone calls. Text doesn&#8217;t take up much time to read, while voice calls means that you have to spend time to listen to them. Is it really worth the investment of a team of engineers to innovate on something that people just don&#8217;t want anymore?

Or am I wrong? Do people really want to talk to people on the phone? Is email or text messages not enough to communicate to someone? Tell me. Leave a comment and proclaim to the world that I am an idiot.
