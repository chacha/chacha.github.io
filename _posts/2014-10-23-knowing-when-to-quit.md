We recently had to stop our Narwhal Coding Challenge early. We had a lot of interest, but ultimately we just couldn&#8217;t sustain it. And this venture reminded me about one of the best ways you can refocus your time: Quit.

Trying new things and getting your feet wet in different ventures are important and worthwhile steps to learning what is necessary to succeed. But, even with a great idea, sometimes you just don&#8217;t have what you need to take a venture all the way. For instance, our attempt at creating an eight week challenge ended up failing because the leadership didn&#8217;t have a clear vision for what what necessary in the challenges, as well as did not have the resources to bring the challenges we did have to fruition.

However, this doesn&#8217;t mean that the effort was not worth the time. Because of this failure, we now know a couple things about what it takes to put on this type of event:

  * **Prepare as much as possible ahead of time. **One of our major failings was the rush to create a challenge, answer, and documentation throughout the week. This meant that the answers were sometimes quickly thought through, and several were just not posted at all. All of this effort, if done beforehand, could have instead have been spent grading submissions making the entire process less stressful.
  * **Find an abundance of committed help**. Most of our judges on the coding challenge were made up of students who had a lot of schoolwork going on, as well as mentors who needed to attend to the needs of the robotics team. In order for something like this to work, the people on the grading side need to be committed. Also, having as many judges as possible would mean that the work would be spread out very evenly so that most people only had to do one or two gradings each week.
  * **Know your audience****.** One reason we had a rush to make challenges and answers is because we did not have a clear audience. At first the vision was to aim at students who knew very little about programming, but this did not challenge our very knowledgable students. This caused us to shift who we aimed our challenges at mid-stream, which dropped the participation as well as caused stress to change the challenges.

All of these problems plagued our coding challenge. Instead of continuing on for another five weeks, we have instead decided to cancel it. Our desire is to not waste time doing things half-heartedly, but instead to focus on the things we can do well.

There is a good chance we will revisit this idea, possibly bringing in our smarter programming students to help us create a series of questions aimed at our newer programmers.
