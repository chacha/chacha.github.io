What do you spend you time on while browsing the Internet? Chances are you have a few different social media services that you use, and each tracks a different part of your online existence. Often these parts are different, like what you post on Twitter might be different than what you post on Facebook. All of these things scattered through the Internet however, they never really combine.<!--more-->

You entire Social Media existence shows a lot about who you are. The stuff you read, share, star, like, retweet, email, digg, clip, reply to, comment on, subscribe to, stumble upon, clik, and bookmark tells a part about the things you like or don’t like. Currently, there is not a single social network, service, or application that can give me everything that a specific person does publicly on the Internet. I can try to find all of your different things, and subscribe to them on the separate networks, but your shares will always be in Google Reader, your Facebook notes in Facebook, and your Twitter messages in Twitter.

Friendfeed tries to do this. They aggregate as many things as possible, through the power of RSS, and allow people to see a good chunk of your online existence on one page. But still, Friendfeed doesn’t get me all the photos and notes in Facebook, and many of the customized features of each social network.

Someone needs to make a open, and secure way, for people to go and grab all of their own information out of social networks, and publicly display them where they choose. If I want all my Facebook photos to show up on my blog, you should give me widgets to do so. If I want to show all my starred items on Google Reader, I should be able to as well.

As the online world becomes bigger, your personal media becomes more scattered across the different platforms you use. And in order for me to find out everything that you want to share with me and the rest of the world, companies need to provide the tools so I can get it all in one place. The Whole is Greater than the Sum of its Parts.
