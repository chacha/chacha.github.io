Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if whatever one of your computers you worked at you had the same files, all ready for you to use on any of your computers? Well, I have found a way to make Dropbox be my Desktop, so anything I put on it is synced with the web, along with my other computers. The best part about this is that it isn&#8217;t cloud computing alone. You always have a copy of the files on your hard drive, so if Dropbox goes down, you don&#8217;t. Here&#8217;s how we do it.<!--more-->

<ol style="text-align:center">
  <li>
    <strong>Download Dropbox at http://getdropbox.com, and set it up</strong><strong><img class="aligncenter" src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/36101/images/dropbox.png" alt="" width="253" height="92" /></strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>(Optional) Set your Dropbox location to somewhere different than you Dropbox folder<br /> </strong>To set your folder to be a different place than the My Documents Folder, Go to Prefrences on the System Tool, and select the folder you want it to be IN<br /> Note: It will still make a folder called &#8220;My Dropbox&#8221; inside the folder you select&#8221;<br /> <img class="alignnone" style="border:5px solid black;margin:10px" src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/36101/images/dropboxchange.png" alt="" width="441" height="477" />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Download and Install TweakUI from Microsoft&#8217;s PowerToys<br /> </strong>Search Google for &#8220;Windows Power Toys&#8221; and the first thing that will come up is Microsoft&#8217;s Power Toys. Here is a <a href="http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=Microsoft+Power+Toys">link</a> for you lazy people. Install the Tweak UI.exe<br /> <img class="aligncenter" style="border:5px solid black;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px" src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/36101/images/powertoyinstall.png" alt="" width="245" height="448" />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Open up TweakUI and change the Desktop Folder<br /> </strong>Open the program and go to My Computer > Special Folders > Desktop > Change.<br /> Then Select your My Dropbox folder, wherever you put it.<br /> <img class="aligncenter" style="border:5px solid black;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px" src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/36101/images/tweakui.png" alt="" width="549" height="448" />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Restart your computer.<br /> </strong>I find that often, the desktop is either laggy, or doesn&#8217;t function right until I either restart, or log off and back on.
  </li>
</ol>

Hope you enjoy your new desktop! Just complete the same process on other machines you want to be in sync, and then drag any file onto your desktop, and it is sync with all of them. Remeber though that Dropbox has a 2GB limit and can be upgraded to 50GB for $100/year. My Computer and My Documents icons will not be synced if you add them by going to (Right Click on Desktop) Properties > Background > Customize. Add them from there.
