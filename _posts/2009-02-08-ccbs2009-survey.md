It time to take the Chacha102 Content Blogging Survey! This is a survey that is not nessicarily annual, that asks bloggers questions about their blogging habbits, and their blogs. Everyone who participates will get a link from me, and I will also probably subscribe to you on Google Reader, if I am not already, and share your interesting articles.Â I plan on putting it up for a week and advertising it, and hoepfully I can actually gain some knowledge from the questions. To take it, click [here](http://cli.gs/rqBsZm).<!--more-->

Basically, you have about 20 questions, some will be published non-anonymously, so will be publish anonymously. Anything that says (Public) will be considered for publishing. At the end there is a link to where the survey results/analysis will be posted, or you can click on one of the link on the top menu bar. Also, you can help me gain knowledge by tweeting about the survey using the other link provided after taking the survey. Or this one:Â http://cli.gs/zT6Y52

Have a Great Day!
