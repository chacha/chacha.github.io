One of our team members disagreed that going to an event like Las Vegas or Arizona was a good idea because it would leave some people out who couldn&#8217;t afford to miss school.

The problem I have with this argument is that you can&#8217;t always make everyone happy. You can do you due diligence by making sure there is at least one regional everyone can attend (San Diego for us), but there will simply be other events people can&#8217;t attend due to parents, money, or school.

We have to be fine with that, otherwise we miss opportunities for the students who can go to really grow and get better and build stronger relationships with their team members.
