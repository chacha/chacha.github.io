[Klassio](http://klassio.com), a very early stage blogging platform, has some interesting features. Instead of focusing on text, Klassio instead focuses on a range of media types. While platforms like WordPress and Blogger require every post to be made up of words, Klassio allows you to create posts using any sort of medium: Photos, Videos, Music, etc. This means that it is trivial to post a video, or music, or anything else you would like to share with the world; no embed code required.
  
The setup of Klassio is very standard. You get a username.klassio.com url to get to your blog, and can select from a couple themes. You can input you own custom CSS, which is helpful if you would like to change the theme yourself.

Klassio is very focused on content. The home screen prompts a large text box ready for a new post to be entered, or you can also select from one of the other supported media types.
  
In the future, I would hope to see a lot of polish put into this product. As of now, there are really only 4-5 pages in the entire admin backend. This is fine, for simplicity is very user friendly. However, if there is going to be a minimal amount of feature, each feature needs to flow with the other features. Think of how Apple does their products. They don&#8217;t have a lot of features, but the features available are polished and highly usable.

The custom CSS might be a little much for most users. I&#8217;d suggest putting in some sort of wizard, similar to how Twitter allows users to style their profile pages, to make it easy for users to change the look of their page without needing to know CSS.

Overall the service is usable, put definitely needs polish.
