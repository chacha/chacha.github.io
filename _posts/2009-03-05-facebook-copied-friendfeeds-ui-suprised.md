Facebook recently announced that they would be changing the format of their home page. Just like the ‘like’ feature they stole from Friendfeed, you can compare the Facebook homepage to the Friendfeed design. If you notice that the ‘News Feed’ and other tabs that were originally on the top of the menu, have now become what Friendfeed calls ‘lists’, where it will filter what is in your center feed depending on which one you are on. Just like the ‘like’ feature, Facebook is slowly taking parts of Friendfeed and imposing it onto it’s service. Why? I’ll explain after the jump.

Why is this important? Because in the end it will fail. Facebook is trying to copy one of the most efficent ways to browse content on the internet, Friendfeed. You can hide entries you don’t like, comment on others, and even sort them using lists and rooms. With ease I can compile a room with everything that concerns a certain person that is up to date using RSS. This goes the same for any topic, type of content, etc. Feel like photography? Find a few flickr accounts, and Friendfeed will import them into a room, where at any time you can get pictures. You can do the same for blogs.

The reason it won’t work for Facebook is simple. It is all part of how Facebook defines relationships. While Friendfeed works on a system where anyone can follow anyone else, aside from private subscriptions, Facebook works on a closed 2-way basis. Most people would rather a relationship be on a 2 way basis. Each of you see each other’s content and gets heard. But the problem is that it is a very big hassle to send a request, wait for it to get accepted, and THEN find out if the person posts good content. With Facebook’s closed atmosphere, it just becomes too hard to start a conversation with as many people as Friendfeed.
