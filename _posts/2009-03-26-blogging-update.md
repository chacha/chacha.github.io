Hey, I just wanted to tell all of you that I didn&#8217;t forget you guys. I am currently working night and day on a project at http://thenextintech.com. I am working on a WordPress theme for them, and finishing all the bugs and stuff. Once this blogging network gets going, I will be taking the position as the main IT guy for both our main blog and hosted blogging network. If you are interested in what we are, drop me an email at chacha@chacha102.com.

Once that blog goes live, I will be writing for it frequently and with the way we have it wired, the content I write will also be published here. So just wait a couple of days and I assure you the posting schedule will get back on track. Thanks for any of you that are still waiting for content, I really appreciate it!
