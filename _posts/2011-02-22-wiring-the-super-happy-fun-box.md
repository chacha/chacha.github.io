<span style="line-height: 1.5;">One of the best parts of the Super Happy Fun Box is that it provides a great deal of cable management. While the inside is a bit messy, the outside of the box is particularly wonderful because there really aren&#8217;t many cables at all. The only cables required are the power cables that connect to each motor.</span>

When the box was designed, it was made to be modular. That means that if the robot changes on the outside, the insides of the box don&#8217;t need to change. While we did make a gigantic step forward in achieving that, it could be better.

In a consumer-grade product, all of the ports that could reasonably be used would be available on the side of the box. While we came close to that, there are still a lot of connections we could have made that would have given us more flexibility later on without having to open the box. For instance, the Robot Signal Light, Spike Relays, as well as any other possible connection should have an available port. That way we don&#8217;t have to go in and put in new wires and connections based on what connection we need. They are already there.
