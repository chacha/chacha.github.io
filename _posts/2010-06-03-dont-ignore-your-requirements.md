I&#8217;m serious. If you are trying to create a blog, a business, or a bicycle, you need to get lay down your requirements.

Any engineer will tell you that the first crucial step of building a complex object is its requirements. What does it need to do? Does it need to move? How big does it need to be? What material is it made out of? These questions are crucial to the process of designing anything. From a wheel, to a car, to a space station, requirements are the building blocks of the design.

Now, ask the same question to someone wanting to start a business, and you&#8217;ll get a variety of answers ranging from surveying users, to building the product, to looking for investors. Now, while a lot of these are crucial parts of the start up process, they all seem to skip by the crucial step of actually planning your business. Before you do anything towards beginning a project, the first thing you need to do is _make a plan_.

Now, making a plan can be anything from starting a Google Document and laying out all of the specifications for the business, to making mock pictures of what the product will look like. In fact, a good plan will probably have a little of everything. The idea behind the plan is to make a clear vision for your product that a designer or an engineer can follow, and that you can reference and modify when you are trying to hone in on your products details.

If you have recently taken a business management course, you might think that this plan would be more like a traditional _business plan_. The traditional business plan includes a history of your industry, who your competition is, who your target audience is, along with a ton of information that is designed to make banks and investors believe your idea will work. While the traditional business plan is important for making your business run, it is more important in the beginning stage to get something on paper, and to get everyone working on the project on the same page.

So, to wrap up, before you try to attempt creating any sort of product, embark on any project, or have an idea you later want to try to realize, make a plan. Make a plan that shows all the parts of the product and can easily explain what the end result should be. It will save you a load of frustration later, and might show you problems that you need to solve before moving forward.
