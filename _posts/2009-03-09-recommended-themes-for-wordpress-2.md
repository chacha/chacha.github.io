Most people use WordPress for blogging. Whether it is WordPress.com’s hosted blogs, or hosting your own, a lot of people are familiar with the service. Unfortunately, you can’t install themes for WordPress.com, so instead I’m going to give you themes I find interesting for self-hosted WordPress blogs. I also am going to give you some other blog posts that I found helpful in finding these themes.

**My Current Theme**

My current theme is a 3 column theme called ‘The Morning After’ by <a href="http://themasterplan.in/" target="_blank">Arun Kale</a>. It has a lot of room for different sections such as featured posts, recent posts, asides, and it is fairly easy to put in more sections if you wish.

**NextTech Blogs’ Themes**

_AlexWilhelm.com_

<a href="http://alexwilhelm.com" target="_blank">Alex Wilhelm’s blog</a> uses a theme called ‘Choice’ by  <a href="http://www.themelab.com/" target="_blank">Theme Lab</a>. It basically is your text, and a sidebar. There isn’t much to it, which means that people focus on your content.

_LostTheTech.com_

<a href="http://lostthetech.com" target="_blank">Holden Page’s blog</a> uses a theme called PassionDuo Red version 1.0 by <a href="http://www.dailyblogtips.com/" target="_blank">Daily Blog Tips</a>. I find it to be very red, but it provides good ad space, full content on the front page, and a 2 column side bar. Simple.<img alt="passionduored.png" src="http://www.dailyblogtips.com/wp-content/uploads/passionduored.png" width="274" height="201" />

_OffBeatMichael.com_

Michael Klurfeld uses a theme called Absynthe made by <a href="http://www.chris-wallace.com/" target="_blank">Christopher Wallace</a>. I don’t have much to say about it.

_TheNextInTech.com_

Our <a href="http://thenextintech.com" target="_blank">aggregation site</a> uses a really cool news portal theme called <a href="http://web2feel.com/monezine/" target="_blank">EPSILON</a>. It has a gliding banner on the top, and provides plenty of room for advertisements and content. I modified the layout a little, and made a few functionality changes, but I think it is a great theme without the changes.

**Themes I recommend**

_<a href="http://www.askgraphics.com/freetemplates/demo/" target="_blank">BlueGray</a> –_ Very simple blog with 2 sidebar columns, advertising slots, and a nice banner to introduce yourself in. I would have used it, except that I think it didn’t have enough places to show content on the front page.

**Sites to find themes**

I personally recommend simply typing “Wordpress Theme’s” into Google Reader’s search bar. Normally the people you read will have tons of recommendations. Also you can Google WordPress Themes, and Mashable has a great post about them.

I also recommend going through Emily Robbin’s list of <a href="http://www.emilyrobbins.com/how-to-blog/wordpress-theme-list-266.htm" target="_blank">980 free wordpress theme</a>s.
