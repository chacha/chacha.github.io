Robert Scoble has said multiple times that the key to getting the most out of places like <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://friendfeed.com/" target="_blank">Friendfeed</a> is following the right people. You have to follow the people you are interested and the people that give the best information. This must work well for him because he spends up to 7 hours a day on Friendfeed, and has 5,400 subscriptions to keep him interested in the latest news.

But what about the rest of us? The people that don’t have 7 hours a day to go through everyone and find the best people to give us information. I want to be able to follow someone and know they are going to give me information on a certain topic. That is where <a href="http://friendfeed.com/directeur" target="_blank">Directeur’s</a> new application comes in. SocialWhois

<!--more-->Made in inspiration of the FreeHour program, SocialWhois allows you to follow people by looking at what their interests or skills are. You simply go to the website, and sign in using your Friendfeed or Twitter account. Then you can either fill in your account information, or if you hit the ‘Voodoo’ button, the site will fill in information for you. The information it fills in is actually fairly accurate, and gives me most of my social network account addresses.

Now it starts to get fun. You can click on a profile, and see the list of skills or interests that person has. Also on the page is a Life stream of everything they post on Delicious, Twitter, and Friendfeed. Everybody is also connected through their interests. You can click on a particular interest that one person has, and it will give you a list of other people with the same interest. Besides that, the site also has a recommended people section where it gives you people that are interested in the same things as you.

Once you find someone you think is interesting, you can bookmark, or &#8216;fave&#8217; them using buttons on their profile. This doesn&#8217;t actually translate into you following them on Twitter or Friendfeed, but it allows you to save their profile, and is easily accessible on the site navigation. After you have found people, you can leave leave public messages to the people you follow on their &#8216;Public Inbox&#8217;, which is powered by Disqus. You can also see other people&#8217;s messages

The entire site has open source features. For every person you can export a buisness card that easily adds to your address book, along with having feeds for different features of the site. Also, the site doesn&#8217;t saved your Twitter/Friendfeed Password, but you do have to enter it to log in.

Overall, the site has all the features you need to find people that have the same interests as you. In the future I think it would be cool to see things like following your faved people on Twitter/Friended, and easily seeing the people you already follow on the two services, to find out more about the person.
