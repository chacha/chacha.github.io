So, I&#8217;ve found many different IP checkers from many different sites, but none of them really have a short url. IPChicken, IPPlease, all are like 9 characters, add the .com and it is at least 14 characters. Instead, I decided to launch an eight character ip finder. Check out IPPlz.com. It provides you with a quick way to view your IP in under 8 characters!

Also, check out the sponsors at <http://thenextintech.com>, and the blog I write for, <http://techgeist.net>. Enjoy.
