Around the time I updated my theme and switched servers, was the same time that I became a member of a new blogging group: NextTech. NextTech is a group of young bloggers who collaborate together on posts and want to build a great place to get smaller blogger&#8217;s posts out into the big world. Alex Wilhelm of [alexwilhelm.com](http://alexwilhelm.com) and I founded this orginization, along with Holden Page of [lostthetech.com](http://lostthetech.com). Since mid-January, we have been recruiting a few bloggers to join our network. We have added Michael Klurfeld of [offbeatmichael.com](http://offbeatmichael.com), and John Hewitt who will be launching his blog soon.<!--more-->

So what makes us unqiue? All of us are in constant communication with each other, Google Talk, Skype, anything. We all collaborate with each other on posts. For instance, we put a post on Google Docs for other members to read for about 4-8 hours before it goes live. In that time, they can edit it, leave comments, etc. Once we come back, we simply fix any errors and post it up.

Currently we are working on the update to our personal aggregation site, [thenextintech.com](http://thenextintech.com), along with a new sponsor to pay for our hosting needs. 

So, if you are interesting in this group, comment, email me at chacha@chacha102.com, chacha@thenextintech.com, or Tweet @chacha102. Hope you will enjoy reading our stuff.
