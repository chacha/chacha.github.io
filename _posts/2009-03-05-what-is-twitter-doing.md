_I am posting this now because I wrote it yesterday, planned on publishing it, waited, and now Twitter announced something new. Pretend like I posted this a month ago, or skip it_

People use Twitter very often. There is no question in that. People debate back and forth about all things concerning Twitter. Some question its worth, while others talk about ways to use it, and still others debate about whether they should debate about Twitter. I’m not here to argue any of that, I’m hear to ask a simple question: What is Twitter doing?<!--more-->

Lately I have seen many people talking about a new UI for Twitter using ‘Power Twitter’ that includes Facebook, and multiple UI enhancements to the Twitter page. People use Tweetdeck and Twhirl on a daily basis. It is a popular service, and many people use it.

Now look at similar services. Facebook is releasing a change to their home page tomorrow, and they changed how they do TOS’s late last month. Friendfeed launched advanced searching earlier this year, but what have we heard from Twitter? The only somewhat interesting news is that Twitter will be releasing an OAuth feature for security sometime soon. But really, what are they doing to make the thousands of users using this service get a bigger benefit?

What is your list of things you’d like Twitter to change? Put them in the comments. Here are mine:

  1. Better Grouping for Friends. 
      1. Allow Friendfeed-like lists of Friends
      2. Have the UI be able to show multiple groups of friends
  2. Allow for public groups of Twitter users. (They should be tweetable by @+groupname, or something similar)
  3. Increase the capabilities of Direct Messages 
      1. Delete All Direct Messages in one click.
      2. Direct message a group of people
      3. Seamless integration with email (I can reply via email)
  4. Various Improvements to the UI 
      1. Calculate the length of the message after the URL is shortened.
      2. Do something useful with Favorites

Tell me your list.
