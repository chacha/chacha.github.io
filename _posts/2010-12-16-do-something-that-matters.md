When high school seniors leave for college, one thing people always ask them is to give advice to other high schoolers. After 4 years of experience, passing down tricks of the trade might just help out all those struggling underclassmen and let them know that there is light at the end of the 4 year tunnel. However, when most people give advice it contains something like &#8220;Keep track of your homework&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t take life too seriously&#8221;. All of these are short simple phrases that are almost cliche. Here is my advice to high schoolers, without the brevity that others so kindly gave you.
  
School is like a library. At the beginning of the semester you pick and choose books you think are interesting and check them out. Maybe you picked up a book on Chemistry, Speech and Debate, English and Algebra 2. Some books are very interesting and contain lots of information you are fascinated by. Other books are dull and don&#8217;t have a very interesting plot line to them. Either way, they are books you checked out and you have to read through them before giving them back to the library. So, you might as well make the best of them. Take notes, get good grades, and when you&#8217;re done make a mental note whether you liked the book or not. Based on your findings you can go and check out a whole new stack of books later.
  
Here&#8217;s the problem. I don&#8217;t like reading bad books. In fact, as soon as I check out a bad book from the library it goes straight to a little desk I have in my house specific stationed for books that need to be returned. I don&#8217;t look at it again, I don&#8217;t try to read through it or make the best of it. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, that book is a waste of my time and I simply don&#8217;t want to read it.
  
This is where classes and books get eerily similar. There are many reasons I might not like a book: the style of writing might be off, the tone the author uses is dull, the book is organized badly, or maybe the information just isn&#8217;t as exciting as it could be. The same can be said with the classroom. Based on the teacher, the subject, and the school, the course might turn out to be a great resource of information that inspires you to think, or it could be a elongated encyclopedia that makes you want to fall asleep. Personally, I&#8217;ve experienced both and I&#8217;m sure you will as well.
  
But how do you deal with the bad books? That&#8217;s simple: You skim.
  
If you&#8217;ve ever had to read a book for a class, you&#8217;ll probably be familiar with this technique. Ten minutes before a chapter quiz and you haven&#8217;t read the chapter assigned for last night. You quietly step away from your friends in the playground to go get the book out of your backpack and skim through to figure out what is important, what happened, and what most likely is on the quiz. You can treat a bad class like this as well. Figure out what is important in a lesson, what you need to get out of it to understand it, and learn that. Don&#8217;t bother trying to delve into the content, reading every word in a chapter, just understand it.
  
You see, the thing about school isn&#8217;t that you need to try to get by. It isn&#8217;t that you love every subject matter you take. The purpose of school is that you learn concepts, and that you learn how to learn concepts. It doesn&#8217;t really matter that you know all of the general&#8217;s names in the Civil War, but it is important that you learn how to remember facts. And once you&#8217;ve gotten the bad classes out of the way, you can pursue more interesting things. For instance, I spent almost a year in high school blogging about news in the technology area and started a blog with some friends that was viewed by over 350,000 people. I know people that have figured out what they need to do to succeed in a class, and then spend that class reading a book or drawing.
  
You spend roughly 4,320 hours in high school. That is 259,200 minutes spent in classrooms, at lunch, or in the middle of periods. Before you spend another minute worry about your classes, worry about something that really matters: you. What do you want to do with your life? What are you interested in pursuing? Don&#8217;t be someone who just sleeps through high school. Don&#8217;t be someone who answers to the calling &#8220;Get good grades in school so you can get into a good college so you can get a good job&#8221;. If you&#8217;re only after a &#8216;good&#8217; job or a &#8216;good&#8217; life, you&#8217;re aren&#8217;t the type of person your teachers want you to be. Your not the type of person your parents want you to be. And you&#8217;re not the type of person I want you to be.
  
If you have to take my advice in a short, once sentence form, it is this: Figure out what you like to do and do that. You need to go to school, and you need to go to college, but you also need to be happy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found that there are only two great causes that it makes sense to live for: To make an impact in the world, and to enjoy life. Living for anything else is not worth the effort.&#8221;
