Going with my theme of new computer posts. I asked myself what are the first things that I am going to put on my computer. The 5 key applications that I could not survive without.

**Firefox**

The jack of all trade applications. It has plugins, is very reliable, and can get the job done. Although Google Chrome is very nice, and I&#8217;d pick it as my primary browser, Firefox can do it all. Its like my IE. When I need something to work, it just works. And yes, that is the slogan for Duracell&#8230;. or was it &#8220;Trusted Everywhere&#8221;.

**Pidign**

While many people don&#8217;t use all the different IM network, I need an application that can handle whatever I want to do with it. I need an app that can connect me to whatever network, and work. Well, Pidign connects to all 4 major networks, and many other smaller ones. That, and being an IRC client, it basically gives me all the chat things I need. It even has a plugin for Skype.<!--more-->

**Twhirl**

Many people swear on using TweetDeck, and many other Twitter clients to get their Tweet Fix. I prefer Twhirl because it can connect to different networks, and it doesn&#8217;t take up a lot of space. With the new release of Twhirl out, it also incorporates Twitter Search for Replies into the mix aswell, giving me one less reason to use TweetDeck.

**iTunes**

Although it is the scourge of the open source community, iTunes is still the best music player I can find. It works the way I want to, and now that songs will be stripped of DRM, there isn&#8217;t much of a reason to not use iTunes. Even if you buy music through Amazon, iTunes still provides a great music player.

**Notepad++**

For anyone who wants to do things anywhere from programming, to simply opening up a document without fear of being hacked, Notepad++ does a great job simply giving me the text out of the document. I&#8217;ve programmed in it for 3 years, and I&#8217;m not turning back.

Some other applications people [suggested](http://friendfeed.com/e/94af08c0-c4b9-46be-8504-0f4440a8b47e/What-are-the-5-applications-you-would-first-put/) were:
