Awhile back, a NextTech logo started appearing on my site. This is because I joined (and co-founded) the NextTech Group, a group of bloggers that collaborate together. Well, soon we will be taking that a step forward.

TheNextInTech.com, will turn into our main blog that will have 4 authors writing about all things technology. This includes my posts about how to become better using the internet, posts from Alex Wilhelm, Holden Page, and Michael Klurfleld. Currently the site is in a design stage, but should be reaady to launch soon. 

So what are we going to do? The NextTech Blog is going to be the main blog that all 4 of us focus on. It will contain news, opinion posts, and all sorts of content about technology. We hope to offer a great variety of opinions about technology from people that will actually be using this content in the next 60 years. Because we will be the ones actually using it, our opinion on technology should be some of the most prominent opinons shaping new servies and products. 

Aside from our central blog, NextTech will offer a free blog hosting service, NextTech Blogs. We will allow you to host your own blog on our service, without limitations like javascript. Because we are so small, we are easy to work with to get the service customized. You can simply email me, chacha@chacha102.com, and we can get new plugins or themes set up for anyone.

If you are interested in this project, and might want to help out, email me at chacha@chacha102.com.
