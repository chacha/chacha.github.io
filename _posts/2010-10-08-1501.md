I have a weird urge to constantly check my email. It is this thought that if someone wants to communicate with me, I should immediately there to respond to them. I think in a big way it hinders my productivity. Instead of doing things I know I should be doing, I do things out of habit like checking email and looking at my news feeder to waste time. Finally, something attracts me away from those habitual activities like a game or tv show, and the original task I wanted to do has forever been swept away.

In a related note, I like to write draft emails. I like to start off thinking I&#8217;m about to create a wealth of productivity because I sent this email, and that it will turn into a great feat in communication. However, these emails often are left with a paragraph and then sit in my draft box. Because my draft folder is not easily accessed in Google Mail, it sits in my draft box for months until I end up deleting it along with 12 others that have been created in a similar manner.
