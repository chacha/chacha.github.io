Since Facebook was created, all sorts of social networks have popped up over the web. You have Foursquare, Twitter, (various copies of Twitter), Flickr, Friendfeed, Delicious, and a hundred or so more. Each network claims to have its own purpose and benefit the internet. I&#8217;m here to claim that more social networks actually are a detriment to the internet, and here is why:

I propose that for every social network that is created on the internet, every other social network becomes less valuable. In an ideal world, you can see this claim play out very easily. To demonstrate this, we are going to create our own imaginary world with the following rules:

  * There are 100 people
  * All social networks have an equal market share
  * A single person only has time to be on 2 social networks

This world should adequately represent the majority of the current world&#8217;s population. Most people won&#8217;t actively participate in more than 2 social networks over a long period of time, and all of this assumes that cross-posting (your post on Facebook gets sync&#8217;d to Twitter) is used by few enough people that it is not statistically significant.

Now, let us say that there are 4 social networks present in this world. Each social network would have 50% of the population active on their network. Now let&#8217;s say that you were magically transported to this world, and you knew 4 people. Because there are only 4 social networks, when you pick the two networks you want to sign up for, there will be a pretty good chance that you will be able to connect with your friends.

In this world, everyone is pretty happy. Because there are only 4 social networks, you can reach just about anyone either directly or through a friend. However, this is where my idea comes into play. Let us say that we add in another social network. If all the rules are followed, this means that each social network will now have less people on it because the new social network has taken some of their users away. This means that the social graph (where your friends are) is now more spread out, making it less likely that you will be able to find your friends on any given social network.

Social networks are a tool for connecting people. That means that they benefit if both you and your friends are on the same network because then you can interact, generate page views, and get the company money. If none of your friends are on a social network, you are far less likely to use it. Therefore in our imaginary world, the more social networks created, the less beneficial any social network is.

If we now look at the real world with this perspective, we can start to realize why huge networks like Facebook and MySpace are so good at gaining traction. The more people on the social network, the more likely someone will be to sign up because they are more likely to find other people they know on that social network. From a user&#8217;s perspective, a social network that is also a monopoly is best. Even if the feature set isn&#8217;t that great, the fact that it is a monopoly makes it much more useful than any competitor&#8217;s site.

Here is the problem: Companies are ran by people. As human beings, owners of large social networks can give into temptation just as easily as the rest of us. They can be lazy on security, sell data to advertisers, and become corrupted just as easily as anyone else. Add that with the fact that because they are a monopoly, people are less likely to leave for their competitors, you&#8217;ve created a recipe for disaster.

So in the end, big social networks are good for users because we can connect with our friends. Privacy is hurt due to the corruptive nature of power, and the fact that as more people join a social network, the less likely they are to leave.
