And I caught it from all of you Friendfeeders who are also sick. Just because one of you is in Australia, one in Canada, and a few on the East Coast, doesn&#8217;t mean you didn&#8217;t give me a virus over here in San Diego. Well, while I am sick I&#8217;ve decided to give you all a nice little batch of updates.

**Windows 7**

Windows 7 will be launching its beta version tomorrow to 25 million people. I don&#8217;t like that 25 million cap because it puts everyone who has to do something, like go to school, out of the loop. Although, if I don&#8217;t get better by tomorrow, you can be sure as heck that I&#8217;ll be downloading it. No sore throat is going to keep me away from trying it out.

Oh, and I just found out that you have to be upgrading from Vista. So, they just missed their entire target audience. The main people they are going to want to target is the XP people who haven&#8217;t upgraded. You want to prove to them that its worth upgrading now so they can finally get rid of XP.

(Yes, I&#8217;m bitter because I won&#8217;t be able to try it.)

**Palm Pre**

The Palm Pre was the smart phone that was released today at CES. It had a nice slide out vertical keyboard, great multi touch, and pretty much everything else the iPhone needs. I haven&#8217;t heard anything about price, battery life, or other things, but it comes with a wireless charger called the Touchstone. [Find more here](http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/08/palm-pre-in-depth-impressions-video-and-huge-hands-on-gallery/).

I think it is going to be hard to beat the iPhone. But from what I&#8217;ve heard this thing comes close to it. Even Robert Scoble is [singing](http://friendfeed.com/e/8a651642-8345-42cc-a294-08ed603cf051/Cut-copy-paste-on-Palm-Pre/) its praises. Yes, it does have Copy/Paste

**Twitter &#8230; s..l..o..w..s..d..o..w&#8230;n**

Twitter hsa been facing technical dificulties all today with keeping its messages up to date. Basically, you recieve all the updates from like 2 hours ago and begin reciveing more current ones afterwards. Check it out on [Twitter Status Blog.](http://status.twitter.com/) (Which they have posted nothing on)

No &#8230; thats not right &#8230; WHERE IS MY FORMATTING????

### In Other News:

Thank you. Twitter Badges, the little things you put on your website to let people know what you latest tweet was, they are causing problems. Any site that has them on will prompt users for a User/Password upon arrival. This is not a good time for that considering all of the issues with security lately.

Well, I want @chacha for my Twitter username, yet those people at chacha.com took it. I would like to make it loud and clear that I came up with the name in 1998, while ChaCha was founded in 2006. Therefore, they have copied me.
