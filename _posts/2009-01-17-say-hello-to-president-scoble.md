  Today I have read probably 3-4 sets of arguments on why Robert Scoble should/shouldn&#8217;t post Amazon Affiliate Links to his Friendfeed/Twitter. Louis Gray even graced us with a post about it, and there has been buzz going on Friendfeed about it all this morning. Some people argue that by posting affiliate links, he might become biased towards the products because he gets a percentage if people buy it.

  The point is that so many people post affiliate links to Amazon product, why should we really care? You don&#8217;t call out the other bloggers that use the affiliate program, why is Robert Scoble so very important? As Chris Baskind put <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/1fda977e-4e4b-4437-aa72-21eb2c047826/Do-you-honestly-believe-that-Scoble-s-affiliate/">here</a>, this is not the first time it has been done. Heck, probably all of you have clicked on 1 or 2 affiliate links without knowing it. So no, there is no reason why everyone is all in a buzz about this. There is a great disscussion going on about this <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/0ca5deaa-5eba-a520-0b83-e4b0b6cdf101/Scoble-Starts-His-FriendFeed-Twitter-Monetization/">here</a>. One of the best points I think that is made is if you really cared about seeing if it was an affiliate link, you could have simply checked to the URL that Friendfeed gives you.

  Another point being made is that Robert could have been &#8216;transparent&#8217; and he could have disclosed that he was infact using an Amazon affiliate link. In 140 Characters I don&#8217;t think it is really worth it to have to relay less information just to be transparent. Robert mentions <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/538eb55b-7609-4fae-becc-a5febc18eb20/Louis-Gray-missed-the-real-story-around/">here</a>, that the URL, in and of itself was the disclourse. If you really cared, you could simply glance over and notice the fact that it was an affiliate link.

  I think this entire conversation is complete bull. People have used, use, and will use affiliate links because they are generating content that they want to make money back from. If you give a review and someone buys the item after clicking a link on your blog, you provided the link, so why don&#8217;t you get some of the revenue if a sale goes through? Please comment if you think I&#8217;m off my rocker&#8230;
