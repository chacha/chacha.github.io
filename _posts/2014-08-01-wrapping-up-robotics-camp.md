This day marked the last day that I personally will be leading robotics camp. Next week Garrison Price, my co-mentor, will lead our motley crew into a last week of camp before we close for the summer. Â Let me tell you, this summer has been simply amazing.

For four weeks we have 9-12 year old campers joining us to build robots. During the week they get to both figure out challenges in pairs of two and help build a large life-sized tennis ball shooting robot.

Over the last three weeks I&#8217;ve got to work with so very intelligent and brilliant kids. Many of our campers took our challenges and immediately soared with it, working to figure out a solution and make the best robot possible to solve it. Even more, the one-on-one competitions were incredible because we got to see a lot of robots all compete against each other in games like tug-o-war, sumo, and street sweeper.

Talking with our leadership for the past weeks, we are very excited to see what we can do next year. There is a whole score of things we want to do better, and there is so much already established that we can build on.

To all of the parents and counselors that helped make the camp possible, I say thank you. I had one of the greatest summers of my life.
