&#160; Chrome vs Firefox. This debate has been happening for a long time, and I think there is a clear winner, simply because of the URL bar. Let me explain. Chrome allows me to easily build a URL in a few keystrokes, and autocomplete’s URLs instead of requiring me to click on something to complete it. 

1 : Auto Completion

As you begin typing in Chrome, even at the first letter, you will have a website recommendation from your past history. Look at this, after typing ‘a’, it shows me a recommendation.

Now, I can hit enter, or I can keep typing. As I continue typing, the addresses just keep changing. If I see the right one, I can simply press enter, and I go to the website.

Compare this now, to Firefox. Once I type, I must either click or scroll with my mouse buttons in order to pick a URL.</p>

2 : Building a URL

Sometimes, for people who know how websites are structured, you want to build a URL. To build off the fact that Chrome autocomplete’s URL&#8217;s for me, if I want to add something to the end, I just simply have to tap the right arrow key, and I will be at the end of the URL, ready to type.

3 : Google Suggest

The last thing that I would like to praise Google Chrome on is that fact that Google Suggestion is built right in, so that as I type, no matter what letter I am on, it will search my history, and relevant Google results, to give me more options. Firefox however simply gives me a search of my history, and often returns irrelevant results. for example, if I type q, Google Mail shows up because the key (The long hash tag of like 25 characters), has a q in it.

While some of this may seem to just be nit picking at Firefox, I think that Google’s ease of use for their address bar makes it more fun to browse the internet on. Anyone care to disagree? Post it in the comments.
