**Week Two: Reversing Sentences**
  
Yousuf Soliman

This week&#8217;s challenge is to write a program to reverse the order of words given in a string.

Sample Input

    this is a test
    foobar
    all your base
    class
    pony along
    

Sample Output

    test a is this
    foobar
    base your all
    class
    along pony
    

We have provided a series of datasets for you to test with. The first line of the file gives the number of cases, `n`. On the follow lines are `n` sets of cases. For each case there will be a line of letters and space characters indicating a list of space separated words. Spaces will not appear at the start or end of a line.
