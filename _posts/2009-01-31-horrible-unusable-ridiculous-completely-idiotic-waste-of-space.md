I have 2 montiors and might aswell keep some stuff on there to use it up. I go, look at the pre-given gadgets, and what do I find? An RSS Gadget. Not just any RSS Gadget, the only RSS Gadget that comes installed with Windows 7. And not only the only RSS Gadget installed with Windows 7, a RSS Gadget installed with Windows 7 that it tied to the horrible, unusable, ridiculous, completely idiotic, waste of space we call Internet Explorer. So I decide, well I don&#8217;t want to use the RSS Gadget installed with Windows 7 that is tied to the horrible unusable, ridiculous, completely idiotic, waste of space we call Internet Explorer, so I decided to search online for RSS Gadgets. All I found were RSS gadgets that linked to specific blogs, none of which I really wanted to read.<!--more-->

So, I am left with an RSS Gadget that is tied to the horrible, unusable, ridiculous, completely idiotic, waste of space we call Internet Explorer. And now, everytime I want to change my RSS feeds on my desktop, I have to open that horrible, unusable, ridiculous, waste of space we call Internet Explorer, and add my feed to some weird Feed Reader I will never use. If you know of a RSS gadget not linked to the horrible, unusable, ridiculous, completely idiotic, waste of space we call Internet Explorer, comment or send me an email at rssreader@chacha102.com
