I just published a [pgp key](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x89D5D3850A5AAA13)Â that you can use to send secure messages to my [email](mailto:tyler@tylercarter.org).

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is actually a very interesting protocol that is used in many places online today. You can get started by reading the [GPG handbook](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html).
