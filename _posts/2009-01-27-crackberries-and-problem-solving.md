So, over this 4 weekend break, I have taken an interest in the iTunes U section of the Music Store. In there are many lectures given at universites like Yale, CMU, and others. A lot of these give Audio and Video ways to watch/listen, and each provide interesting information. On my last post I provided you with the m y 4 favorite lectures so far. Now I&#8217;m going to give you 2 more. I&#8217;ve also included a quick notes link to my notes about the lectures. I tried to pick out some of the interesting parts.

  Barry Nalebuff goes over a lot of interesting points in this lecture. One of the best points I think he is makes in his lecture is that we can&#8217;t just go back to the old way of doing things. We can&#8217;t stay in the same spot, and continue to be alright. we have to have an open mind to new ideas, and learn to adapt. He talks about 3 main ways to solve problems: Take the Problem and look for an answer, Look at the incentives for someone to do something you don&#8217;t want, and start with the answer and look for a good question.
</div>

<div>
  The first way is probably the most common. You start with a Problem. In the lecture he used:
</div>

 

<div>
  &#8220;You get a fax machine calling your bedroom at 3am, what do you do to stop this?&#8221;.
</div>

 

<div>
  He then says to pretend your Donald Trump. If Donald Trump were solving this problem, he would get someone to screen his calls. But Who is up at 3 am? You could outsource it from India or another place, they are awake, but that cost some money and not everyone can do that. So who do you know is awake if you are getting a call? The Caller! You could get the caller to press a button if this call is really important, or otherwise go to answering machine. This also solves our first problem aswell, because the fax wouldn&#8217;t be able to figure it out. AT&T also bases an entire service around this feature. I won&#8217;t go into the other two, but I defenitly suggest listening to this. (About 40 minutes)

  JoAnne Yates studied a group of people who have had Blackberrys for a while, and is currently studying another group of people who jsut started using Blackberrys. What sher and her team have found out is very interesting. Many people say that Blackberrys make life more productive and less stressful, when actually the constant monitoring among other habits, provide new stress into lives. Very interesting listen. (About 50 minutes)
