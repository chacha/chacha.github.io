This question has been arising in my mind for awhile now. What exactly do I blog about? Do I talk about Social Media? How to blog? Do I focus on Twitter or something else? I think that it is very crucial to find exactly what you are blogging about, because then you can actually wrap your mind around the extent of your blog. If you asked me what types of blog posts I do, I really couldnâ€™t answer you, because they are soon separated. But, after around 4 months of blogging, I finally has chosen a subject: Become Better at blank.

There are a lot of blogs that focus on how to become better at blogging, social media, writing, photoshop, programming, you name it, they have it. But I think that there is a lot more that people want to know than just how to blog, or how to write. Instead, I am going to combine most of these subjects into a 3-4 post a week blog focused around becoming better with the Internet. In the end, I think that people enjoy learning things. I know that I go through a large amount of blog posts a week trying to find posts that allow me to learn something new, and I think there are others like. 

If you have any suggestions for topics I should write about, or would like to guest post, please send me an email at <chacha@chacha102.com>. Enjoy!
