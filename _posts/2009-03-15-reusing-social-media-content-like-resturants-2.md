Imagine Social Media like a lot of resturants that you own. Each of them serve something different. At Chacha102&#8217;s Click and Link you can get our semi-famous bookmarks, while at the Cha-Cha-Chatroom and Lounge you get a heaping plate of twitter messages. Each of these resturants has something unique about them. Each serves a different style of media that different types of people like. Some people might like your brand of bookmarks more than your tweets, so they end up visiting your Twitter page more than your Delicious page. But, one day, you decide to launch a new resturant called ChaChapaloza which serves your new invention, The YouTube Slammer. Now, you already have peopel going to your other resturants, but how do you get people to go to your new resturant?

One method you might try is to advertise your new resturant at your existing places. This works fairly well for most people, because if they are already interested in your style of bookmarks, they might want to go try your videos. If you plan on launching any new part of your &#8216;Social Media Empire&#8217;, I strongly suggest doing this. But what if you want to introduce the people that visit your Twitter page, your Delicious page, your Blog, and your videos, and make it easy for them to find you anywhere?

This is where deciding what your focal point in social media is going to be. Often people use their blog as the main place for their content. I try to use it as my main page, and I&#8217;ll be implementing more things to allow it to be. But how exactly would I, or you, go about making it my focal point? Here is where we come to the point of this post, besides making you hungry.

For a site to really be a place for all of your content, you need to display everything relative to how relevant it is to your website. If your website is about marketting, but your tweets are mainly focused on your personal life, you shouldn&#8217;t make them one of the focal points of the website. You should still put it on the website, incase people are interested, but not in the most prominent position. 

Take a look at David Risely&#8217;s [blog](http://www.davidrisley.com/). Notice that Twitter is still on his blog, but because his videos and blog entries are more relevant to his topic, making money while blogging, they are more pominent. Therefore it is likely that his content is going to be viewed by anyone who visits his blog, instead of only people who visit his Vimeo account. 

That is the key. Make sure that people can go to one place to see all of your content, and everything is displayed prominetly. Everyone has said that your home page is the representation of you, yet many people simply link to their Twitter accounts and other profiles. Why not actually bring to content to the user so they can see it without clicking? Not only does it make you look like you know more on your subject, it also reuses the content that you have taken time to make.
