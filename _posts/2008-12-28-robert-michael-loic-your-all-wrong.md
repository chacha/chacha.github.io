That is right, I said it. You&#8217;re all wrong!

Incase you haven&#8217;t been following all of this blogosphere hysteria, here is everything you need to know about the debate on: Twitter Search: Followers vs Value. [Michael Arrington](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/26/should-twitter-add-authority-based-search/) first brought this idea to the masses after [Loic Le Muer](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2008/12/twitter-we-need-search-by-authority.html) posted asking for a feature to sort through large amounts of tweets by the number of people that follower the person who tweeted it. In[ numerous](http://friendfeed.com/e/77a713e7-7d62-5568-82f9-45dcef500cbd/Bloggers-Lose-The-Plot-Over-Twitter/) [Friendfeed](http://friendfeed.com/e/b8698864-1fdd-44e8-3327-328658425e89/Thanks-Mike-Arrington-for-taking-us-off-the-rails/) disscussions, most of the [top bloggers](http://friendfeed.com/e/04ffa67d-736e-422f-a319-9558d52fea24/I-think-this-whole-argument-is-bullshit-I-will/) have been arguing with people on this subject.  [Robert Scoble ](http://scobleizer.com/2008/12/28/twitter-idiot-land/)has [posted numerous times](http://scobleizer.com/2008/12/27/5127/) on the issue, and seems to be one of the main people backing up the idea that tweets should be ranked on Retweets and the number of links/replies the tweet gets. Most of the conversations can be followed by looking through his [profile](http://friendfeed.com/scobleizer).<!--more-->

The fact is that a lot of people want Twitter search to have more capabilities than it currently has. I think either side of the argument really isn&#8217;t going to cut it because people want functionality. The fact is that both parties are partially right, or wrong. Having a &#8216;value&#8217; related to tweets to sort them is very important, but this isn&#8217;t something anyone can define. No matter how hard any of try, Twitter was founded on the fact that everyone uses it differently. How can we set what the value of a tweet is if the service is used differently by everyone? You just can&#8217;t. 

Scoble has used it for a year in order to enlighten himself, while Arrington has piped his blog through letting everyone know another start-up has been reviewed. So many people use the service differently that it is stupid to event ry to define a value for tweets. Maybe Loic wants to find out what was said about Le Web that is heard by a lot of people, search by followers would be very good for that. Robert Scoble wants to find tweets about Friendfeed that caused a lot of conversation, there comes your search via @replies and retweets. 

So I think we should call a truce. Both sides have some merit to it. For PR, and marketting in any fashion, finding out whats being heard by the most people(# of followers), and what is being conversed about (@replies), is overall going to give you a better understanding of the Twitterverse. 

It has been a crazy holiday season, and just like in a house, if you get too many people in it at the same time for too long, something is going to give.
