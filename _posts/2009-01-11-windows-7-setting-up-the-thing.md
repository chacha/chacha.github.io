I meant to write something useful today. I really did. I meant to sit down, open up the browser, and write a fully featured and useful blog post. It never happened. Instead I decided to install Windows 7 on a virtual machine today, and will give you a review when I&#8217;ve tested it out for awhile. Here are my first impressions.

After a weekend of shakey downloading from Microsoft, Windows 7 has been released in a beta to an indefinite amount of users, unlike the 2.5 million cap it had before this Friday. Originally, only 2.5 million people were oging to be able to download it. After Microsoft had to shut down the downloads because of the massive traffic, they reopned it without a cap. Alex Wilhelm gave me all the links [here](http://www.alexwilhelm.com/alex_wilhelm/2009/01/how-to-install-windows-7-on-a-vista-computer.html)_._ I downloaded it, and it was annoying. Why? Because Microsoft, is Microsoft. <!--more-->

So, the whole beta sign up process only works in IE or Firefox. And the download only works in IE. So I spent probably 20 minutes trying to figure out how to download the thing.

First you have to select 32 or 64-bit and your language [here](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/beta-download.aspx). Then it takes you to a sign in page where you have to sign in with your Windows ID. It will give you a Product Key, and a button to &#8216;Download&#8217;. Now the thing is, you can get to the button in Firefox, but can&#8217;t click it. It just won&#8217;t do anything. 

The only way you can &#8216;Download&#8217; is is through the Microsoft Download Manager. The page will only prompt you to install it if you are running IE. So, after hitting the &#8216;Download&#8217; button 50 times in Firefox, and 50 more in Chrome, I downloaded IE8. That itself was an annoyance because I had to restart my entire computer. 

This bugs me, because many companies won&#8217;t spell it out in plain English what you can and can&#8217;t do. It would be nice is Microsoft put a little warning saying, &#8220;We are sorry but to download the software, you must be using Internet Explorer&#8221;. It takes about 10 seconds to write and would save a lot of people trouble. I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve been baffled by a FAQ/Support section because it won&#8217;t be clear on the requirements to use the site. 

_On a side note: Not only should FAQ/Support sections say requirements for the site, but if you can use the site without X, but you&#8217;ll lose feature A._

So, after this entire thing was downloaded, I decided to use Microsoft Virtual PC to install Windows. It took about 30 minutes and was virtually painless. The Setup process required about 3 restarts, and everything worked out. The first time booting into Windows 7 leaves a very good impression. The bottom toolbar is a very nice change from the XP toolbar, and works pretty well. 

I haven&#8217;t done much indepth because the Virtual Machine version is really slow. Tonight I will be installing it over my broken Linux partition that refused to work properly with my two monitors. I look forward to writing about this in upcoming articles.
