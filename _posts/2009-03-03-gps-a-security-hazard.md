Cell Phones right now are among the most common devices used. Anything from smart phones to cell phones, the world is at our fingertips with these devices and we carry them wherever we go. Some companies are advertising the ability for parents to track where their kids are. Others allow for mapping your location on the go. But where do we draw the line between privacy, and functionality.<!--more-->

Barrett Sheridan of Newsweek points out in [this](http://www.newsweek.com/id/186970) article, that the GPS on many devices are used for things such as traffic display, child tracking, and more. Having a large amount of data is perfectly fine. Even individual data using cars and such is fine, because the closest people can see is your car. But when tracking is enabled in things like cell phones, it becomes a privacy hazard for the person carrying the phone. If someone could track your movement down to 10 feet of where you are standing, you start to get into the zone of super private data. Most sites only provide you with someone’s location within a specific range, like 50 feet, 100 feet, or city level tracking.

If you can see close enough to where someone is, it means that if the security of your data is compromised, and that means that someone can physically find you. That is bad, in case you were wondering.

Now, I’m not suggesting that we all become angry mobs and go protest the cell phone companies. But when you allow your location to be sent to a database, you should expect the company to properly keep the data anonymous. Maybe that means that the company allows you to set to have it record a more general location, or maybe it means that you set times during the day that it can track you. Better yet, make certain areas untrackable. I think it would be very nice if I could tell my cell phone that when I am 1 mile from my home, don’t record anything. You could also do the opposite, make everything in this specific region trackable.

So, the next time you pick up your phone, remember that while it is a great tool, it comes with some risks. A tool is only as good or evil as it’s wielders intent.
