If you have ever had a bunch of relatives cooped up in a house for too long, your probably seeing the same effect on Twitter and Friendfeed. Tonight Robert Scoble decided to block Dave Winer after both of them having been at each other&#8217;s necks for a good portion of the holidays. This is kind of sad because the meaning of the holidays is to bring people together, not create conflict. Either way, things are finally starting to calm down. <!--more-->

I posted a blog post here earlier and took it down, ranting about this entire argument. I felt that it was too much ranting, so I decided to pull it down. But here is the jist of it: For the last 2 weeks, a lot of people have been arguing about either Twitter Authority or Robert Scoble. There is a lot more to talk about than these two subject, yet some of the more popular people on Twitter/Friendfeed are focused on it. Twitter and Friendfeed need to become tools for getting the news. You don&#8217;t talk alot about how you sort this email automatically in order to get the information. The information itself is the key part of the process. 

Let Robert Scoble do his thing, and let people put the authority of Twitter where they want it. The fact is that everyone uses their applications differently, and it shouldn&#8217;t be the primary area of concern. 

2008 was an interesting year, but lets get back to normal.
