Today I&#8217;m proud to announce the opening of Canyon Crest Academy&#8217;s first robotics camp. Over the past couple months, a lot of work has come together to make a camp that will bring children 9-12 years old together to become inspired by science, engineering, and robotics.

I&#8217;m super happy that we are officially open and ready for sign ups. We really are excited to invite around 80 kids to join us over the summer and are looking forward to the fun and learning that will happen right in the middle of Carmel Valley over the summer.

Thanks to all the hard work of Carolyn Cohen at the Canyon Crest
  
Academy Foundation, as well as the entire staff at Canyon Crest Academy for working with us to make this camp a reality.
