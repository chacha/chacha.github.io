At the San Diego Regional this year, [Team 3128](http://team3128.org) introduced the Narwhal Safety Challenge. The goal of the challenge was to get students interested in safety while also giving out fun prizes.

The basis was that each team got 5 randomly selected cards of the 5 different types available. They then had to trade with other teams to collect a set of 5 unique cards and hand them in to get buttons.

**What worked?**

The biggest thing that worked was the format. It was easy for people to understand and get behind because they knew exactly what they were doing. We had people coming up to us at the pit within 10-15 minutes of us handing out the cards.

**What didn&#8217;t work?**

It was too easy. Â Teams finished really quickly meaning that it wasn&#8217;t challenging enough so the fun only lasted for a little while. This made it less of a big deal that the teams had won.

As the game went on, more and more people had finished thus meaning the people who started later in the game had less opportunity to trade with the teams. This made it less fun.

Also, we didn&#8217;t have a good way to track which teams had finished the game. And when teams did finish the game, the number of buttons we gave out varied on how many people came to the pit.

**What should we do better?**

Our first step to improving the game is making it last longer. This could be done a number of ways. One of the ways we thought of is giving teams 5 of the same card to start out with. This means that they would need to preform at least 4 trades in order to win the challenge.

Another way would be to add riddles or puzzles that people needed to solve in addition to getting all the cards. This would mean that they would both need to trade with other teams as well as test their minds.

We also might introduce &#8216;team cards&#8217;, or cards that each team would get one of and would be turned in when receiving the prize. This would let us keep track of the number of teams that have won better and limit the number of prizes we give out.

Finally, we should divide out the buttons to give each team 10-20 buttons as a reward instead of playing it by ear. It might mean that there are more buttons flying around in the arena, but its more about the challenge than the reward anyway.
