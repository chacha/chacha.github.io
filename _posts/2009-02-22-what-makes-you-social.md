What about when you have to use the Twitter site because you have ran out of API calls? When you are inconvenienced, it takes away from the true purpose of whatever network you happen to be on. You aren&#8217;t social any more.

Iâ€™m convinced that if Apple created a social network like Twitter, many things would be different from the current social networks we see. While the culture of Apple might make the network weird, the features and layout would probably be very seamless. It would be easy to update your feed, and follow other people. You would probably be able to sort contacts by list, and import them from elsewhere. Heck, there would probably be a lot of features that we canâ€™t even think of. But what this endless rant comes down to is the fact that it the entire web page would sink away, and it would just simply be you, and the people you follow.

Meebo has been a very good site at allowing you to get all your contacts in one place. I have yet to see a client that supports Google Talk(Jabber), and Facebook. Meebo even does little alerts when your friends go on and offline of Facebook, something Iâ€™ve found a lot more useful than checking the Facebook page everyday. It is simple things like that, the things that just make it easier to be social, that really garner attention. If you can actually find yourself being more social and interact with more people using a service, youâ€™ve probably found a great service. I personally found myself talking to more of the people I have on Facebook and IM networks just because I notice that they are on, and I donâ€™t have to go to Facebook to find out.

Another way Meebo allows me to connect with more people in a single place is its use of Meebo On Site Chat. This allows me to embed a little widget on my site, and anyone can chat with me while Iâ€™m on, or leave me a message while Iâ€™m not. The ability to connect with the author of a webpage very easily means that if it is things like blogging, it is very easy to get someone Google Talk or Skype so you can talk to them (or just talk right in the Meebo client). For things other than blogging, I think it would be excellent for website support if the IT department could be left messages on things like Meebo, that something happened on their site.

Another application Iâ€™ve used is Feedly. Feedly is a magazine style feed reader that basically beautifies reading news feeds. It allows you to view them in many different ways and integrates Social Networks really well. You can quickly see all the articles on Friendfeed that are linking to the specific article, and you can comment, Tweet, and email the articles right from Feedly. Ever since using Feedly, my friends have gotten a steady stream of stories emailed directly to their inbox. And who better to give it to them than someone who reads over 200 articles a day.

What applications make you more social? With the wide variety to choose from, which have you tried?

Also, what makes you social while blogging? What are the tools that give you ideas and support for posts on your blog? I find that often I will see a really cool article on Friendfeed, or a comment on Twitter, and Iâ€™ll write about it. Do you use something else to get inspiration for posts?
