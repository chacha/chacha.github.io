Every, single, blogger, will someday come to the awful conclusion that their next post will be titled: &#8220;How to use Social Media&#8221;, and the content of that post will somehow relate to that. I know what you are thinking, and No, I don&#8217;t plan on doing something different.

In short, there are a lot of new sites out there. [This site](http://usernamecheck.com/) can attest to that. You would be surprised who you can find.

&#8230;.. (Here is where I stop to check the TWhirl Notification that popped up)&#8230;.

<img style="margin:0 0 0 20px" src="http://www.canadianreggaeworld.com/logo_facebook.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="56" align="right" />So, as I was saying: After 15 years at my church, I just realized this year that almost my entire church was on Facebook. And after 1 year of friending them, not only has my life been easier when I forget things like events and such, I can also know what&#8217;s happening in their life and comment on it.

These services over the past few years have gained a fair amount of publicity to the &#8216;main steam media&#8217;. They say that every 2 days, almost 1 million people sign up for Facebook*. That&#8217;s a lot of people. So lets see: **1) Connect with Friends &#8230;. (Insert Duh Here)**

****Â 

Moving on, one of the best uses for social media is finding new content. And instead of talking about &#8216;How&#8217; to find new content, I&#8217;m talking about &#8216;How&#8217; the new content comes to you, and which way I think is better.

The first way is the Twitter way. Its fairly simple. You subscribe to a friend, and that friend sends you a link.

<img src="http://assets1.twitter.com/images/twitter_logo_s.png" alt="Twitter.com" width="175" height="41" align="right" />That&#8217;s it&#8230;.

Seriously, that is all that happens on Twitter.

Some people make it sound very exciting because once you get about 500 people, all the information comes up very, very, fast. Really the only difference between Twitter and a mailing list is that A) You can see all the messages without subscribing, and B) You don&#8217;t have the 140 char length. Not to say that Twitter isn&#8217;t a great source of information. I very strongly believe that opening up TWhirl is probably opening the single most knowledgeable application on my computer. But still, I explained what happens in 12 words, a comma, and a period.

<img style="margin:0 0 0 20px" src="http://friendfeed.com/static/images/bg-logo-big.png?v=3a1dad64cbff1e360d40e1628164d3c3" alt="FriendFeed" align="right" />Now is when I begin to sound, really, really, biased. Mainly because it takes a little longer to describe what Friendfeed does. But just to be fair, I&#8217;ll describe it in the same manner.

You subscribe to Bob. You get all of Bob&#8217;s entries. Bob subscribes to Mary. If Mary posts something Bob &#8216;likes&#8217;, everyone (including you) who is subscribed to Bob gets the entry in their home feed, as well as everyone subscribed to Mary.

It takes a little thinking to fully get it, but eventually it will click. The cool thing about Friendfeed as opposed to Twitter is the &#8216;like&#8217; thing. Because every entry anyone on the site posts can very easily get to over 500+ people, with just a few people liking it. There is a lot more I could say about the cool stuff with Friendfeed, but I&#8217;ll save that. So, check that one under **2) Find New Content (Very Unoriginal Points, I know)**

<img style="margin:0 0 0 20px" src="http://www.simpsonstrivia.com.ar/simpsons-photos/wallpapers/homer-simpson-wallpaper-brain-1024.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="112" align="right" />Lastly, I think the most helpful out of the three points (wait for the pun), is the helping out portion. A lot of people crowdsource the people following them to find answers to questions. As many have said before 2 head make better than 1, and the 100 people subscribing to me via Friendfeed are definitely more knowledgeable than just me. The greatest thing in the word is when you having been racking your brain for hours trying to find something, or answer a question, and then you remember to post it up on Twitter, and you get a dozen responses. But not only Twitter holds this capability. Crowdsourcing is why people like Robert Scoble, Leo Laporte, and others follow so many people on so many different networks. You suddenly get to tap into the minds of everyone you follow, allowing you with great ease to get the information you need. Heck, Leo Laporte created his own [Open Source Twitter Network](http://army.twit.tv/) for geek&#8217;s to ask questions on and create a community.(And if your on there, follow me [here](http://army.twit.tv/chacha102)) That right there is the reason Social Media is so very useful. So lets put a giant check up for that one:

**3) Tapping into Peoples Brains**

There you have it. The classic, &#8216;How do I use Social Media&#8217; post, done Chacha style. Including Logos, Bold Words, and Text. Giant&#8230; Walls&#8230; of Text.

Giant &#8230;. Walls&#8230; of &#8230;.. Text&#8230;

&#8230;..(Checks TWhirl Again)&#8230;&#8230;

Well that&#8217;s all the time I have tonight. If you really want more to read, go to my [Friendfeed,](http://friendfeed.com/chacha102) [Twitter](http://twitter.com/chacha102), or other posts on [this blog](http://tandmnews.wordpress.com/).

After that, if you are still bored, try listening to some of Leo Laporte&#8217;s stuff at [Twit.tv.](http://twit.tv)

Merry Christmas!
