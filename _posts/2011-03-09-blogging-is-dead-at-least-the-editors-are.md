There are millions of blogs currently on the web. It is easy for anyone to set up a blog hosted on wordpress.com, tumblr.com, or another free blogging engine. They could also head over to wordpress.org and set up their own install hosted on their server where they have complete control over every aspect of their site. Anyone with a decent internet connection can set up a blog and share their ideas with the world, and millions do everyday. How on earth could blogging be dead?

Well, blogging isn&#8217;t dead. Only the editors are.

Authors for a long time have been given the short end of the stick. Almost every &#8220;blogging tool&#8221; out there slaps a WYSIWYG editor in the backend, adds a few features, and then goes on to focus on the other portions of the site. There isn&#8217;t any attention put into making the content writing experience better. This seems backwards considering that I spend most of my time writing content, rather than playing around with the other features of my blog. And if I&#8217;m going to spend most of my time in the editor, shouldn&#8217;t it be a priority in the development process?

WordPress has always been thought to be a writing tool. This is really a unrealistic label. WordPress has few, if any, tools in it that help with actually writing. Nope, WordPress is a publishing tool. The focus of WordPress is on bringing together content, a design, and plugins. If you look at the past improvements to WordPress, you&#8217;ll see most of them focus on the design (custom menus, custom post types*, etc). None of the improvements are focused on the actual writing experience.

The future of blogging is not in who can create the coolest looking site design. The future of blogging will be held in how people create content, and making this experience as easy, productive, and pleasurable as possible.

Many people have recently came out and said that they are switching to Tumblr. Tumblr is interesting because it takes the normal blog post (mainly comprised of text), and expands it with different multimedia types. While WordPress requires you to type text for each blog post, Tumblr doesn&#8217;t care whether you give it text, a link, or an image. It even lets you put in things like quotes and displays it in a way that makes sense. Tumblr is the first platform that actually took a step back and decide they would look at the editor, and how authors create content. Ultimately, this led to an improvement in how posts are created and caused many authors to prefer it over WordPress. While text is a great medium for blogging, multimedia is quickly taking over the web. Blogging platforms need to see this, and adapt to make it easy for users to share multimedia without the need for embed codes, or even having to write a post at all.

**Summary?** Content is king. Make it easier for me to write my content.

* Yes, Custom Post Types generally are related to the content portion of the site. However, custom post types are simply means for categorizing posts, and adding different types of meta data to it. There isn&#8217;t really much that actually lends to the content writing experience.
