About a year ago, I enrolled myself into a Business Management/Ownership class at my high school. The class had only been taught one semester before, and it was a very open curriculum. The teacher for that class was very interesting. He was a entrepreneur who had ran his own restaurant, and then moved to teaching in high schools. He was very laid back, and taught the class in a way that focused the students on engaging with the material instead of grasping for points.

If there was one thing that teacher taught me, it was that before you starting doing something, you need to know why you are doing it. If there isn&#8217;t a motivation behind what you are doing, you don&#8217;t have a reason to be actively involved in the process.

So, I&#8217;d like to start my blog by writing down why I am starting my blog.

> I am starting a blog in order to convey my thoughts about programming, technology and life, to other people.

Over the next few weeks you can expect to see posts popping up on various subjects. I hope to get a weekly posting schedule, but it is very possible that this might fluctuate.

All of my old posts have been unpublished, and I might publish them again in the future. As for right now, I&#8217;m starting with a fresh slate.
