Yes, I guess I will do this blog post aswell. Giving you 25 things that you may not know about me. And then afterwards because I am not very interesting, I&#8217;ll link to 15 other people that have done the same thing.

  1. I bought an iPod in August for my birthday. Returned it because of the lining was peeling, bought another, returned that one and got the 2nd Gen. (Costco Rules)
  2. I have 2 monitors on my desktop, 1 laptop, and an iPod
  3. I like to put my feet ontop of the case of my computer.
  4. My chair deserves the title : &#8220;Squeakiest Chair in the Universe&#8221;
  5. I don&#8217;t switch to the new light bulbs because my kitten likes the heat from the old ones.
  6. I almost never charge my cellphone because I forget.
  7. I spend at least 3-5 days a week at my church helping out.
  8. I have no idea what a &#8216;visionary&#8217; is.<!--more-->

  9. I created a &#8216;club&#8217; for friends at school. We had our own website and called our club: Area62b.
 10. I intend to do something in the world that will leave it a better place when I die.
 11. I am a Christain.
 12. I think that every curse word, if used with its proper meaning, has a place in society.
 13. Most of the teachers I&#8217;ve had in Highschool could have been replaced by monkeys, and test scores would have risen.
 14. I instant message my dad on AIM throughout the schoolday.
 15. My iPod Touch has never ran out of battery
 16. My Laptop has only ran out of battery twice because of me leaving it on Standby during the night isntead of Off.
 17. I subscribe to podcasts, but haven&#8217;t listened to one for a month. Meaning I have 150 taking up space in iTunes
 18. I will open up a single website on my Laptop and a window on each of my screens, and refresh all of them expecting something different (Definition of Insanity) All without realizing what I am doing.
 19. I have actually had 3-4 blogs, and I quit most of them.
 20. I learned PHP/HTML and CSS when I was 14.
 21. My Dad has ran a 2,000+ member orginization of gamers since 1991
 22. My Dad plays World of Warcraft more than me.
 23. I ignore most Flickr entries on Friendfeed
 24. I automatically skip any entries in Google Reader that is an excerpt and I have to click-through
 25. One of my dogs is jealous of our kitten, and constantly comes close to sitting on her<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-223" style="margin:10px" src="http://tandmnews.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/img_0350.jpg?w=300" alt="img_0350" width="300" height="225" />

I also decided to list 25 Other People, with 25 other things, that you probably didn&#8217;t know about them:

_I will seperate this list into 2 sections: People with Last Name, and People with Last Names (Because I Can)_

_All Entries are Blog Posts unless otherwise noted._
