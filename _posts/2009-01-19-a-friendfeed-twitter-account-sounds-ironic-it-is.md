So, some people like to have the content they produce on Friendfeed to be sent to Twitter. I happen to be one of these people. I like having everything I like go to Twitter, because it is easier to scan, and it also me to reach a broader audience of people (I don&#8217;t only reach the 2 people that follow me on FF, I reach the 2 that follow me on Twitter).

But, when you send all that content to your personal account, you start to get friends, sometimes real life friends, annoyed at you because they don&#8217;t follow 600 people and you flood their feed. Me, being very courtious to my RL friends, decided to create a second Twitter account. Acctually, I decided to create a Twitter account in the middle of a church sermon. But, wherever I decided to create it, it still stands that almost all of my content generated on Friendfeed (Google Reader Shares, Likes, and Blog Posts) will go to http://twitter.com/tandmnews. It will also serve as my communication to anyone who wants to follow my blog, hence that username @tandmnews. 

My question to you is: **Do you use a second Twitter account for any reason? Personal vs Proffessional? Following different people? **

As people generate more content, it will be more important that you only get the items that you want, because those items take up valuble time to look through. Services like Twitter and Friendfeed are going to need to implement better filtering options to be able to zero in on content that is exactly what you want.
